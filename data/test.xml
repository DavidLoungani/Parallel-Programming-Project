The '''AN-22''' was [[France]]'s second air-dropped [[nuclear weapon]], developed as a replacement for the earlier [[AN-11 bomb]], entering service in 1967. It had a similar 60 to 70 [[kiloton]]s yield [[Nuclear fission|fission]] [[warhead]] to the earlier AN-11, but with enhanced safety features and a [[parachute]] retarder to enable it to be dropped at low level. Additionally the casing was redesigned reducing its weight from approximately 1,400 kg (3,000 lb) to around 700 kg (1,500 lb). It was carried by the [[Dassault Mirage IV]]. 

A stockpile of about 40 weapons was maintained, providing one for each of the 36 Mirage IVAs in service, plus several spares. The last warhead was retired on 1 July 1988, at which point the [[Air-Sol Moyenne Portée|ASMP]] [[stand-off weapon]] took over the role previously held by the AN-22.

The '''SS. Cyril and Methodius National Library''' (Национална библиотека „Свети Свети Кирил и Методий“) is the [[national library]] of [[Bulgaria]], situated in the capital city of [[Sofia]]. Founded on 4 April 1878, the library received the status of Bulgarian National Library three years later and the [[Bulgarian National Revival]] Archive was merged into it in 1924.

It is named after &quot;SS. Cyril and Methodius&quot;; [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]]. They are the creators of the [[Glagolitic alphabet]]. The [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic alphabet]] is named after Cyril.

The present building of the library is among the landmarks of Sofia. It was designed by the famous Bulgarian architectural team [[Ivan Vasilyov|Vasilyov]]-[[Dimitur Tsolov]] and completed in the period 1940-1953.

[[File:Calixto García Iñíguez 1898.jpg|right|thumb|Calixto García in 1898]]
'''Calixto García Iñiguez''' (August 4, 1839 &amp;ndash; December 11, 1898) was a general in three [[Cuba]]n uprisings, part of the [[Cuban War for Independence]]: [[Ten Years' War]], the [[Little War (Cuba)|Little War]] and the [[History of Cuba#The War of 1895|War of 1895]], itself sometimes called the Cuban War for Independence, which bled into the [[Spanish-American War]], ultimately resulting in national independence for [[Cuba]].

==Ancestry and progeny==
García was born in [[Holguín]] to parents of [[Cuba]]n ''[[Creole peoples|Criollo]]'' descent; his maternal surname Iñíguez, indicates descendence from [[Iñigo Arista]], Basque King whose forces are referred to as demons in the  [[Song of Roland]].  He was a large, strong, educated man with a short fuse.  García was the grandson of [[Calixto García de Luna e Izquierdo]], who had fought in the [[Battle of Carabobo]] in what is now called [[Venezuela]].  His grandmother was Maria de los Angeles Gonzalez, said to be the daughter of a Cacique Chief from Valencia Venezuela.  His grandfather (who had dropped the aristocratic &quot;de Luna&quot; upon taking refuge in Cuba) had been jailed on March 18, 1837 for demanding emancipation of slaves, constitutional freedom for all, and allegedly trying to hang a priest who opposed him. As befitted a man of importance of that time, Calixto had a wife, Isabel Velez Cabrera, and a good number of mistresses; these women gave birth to many children both legitimate (about 7) and illegitimate (at least six, each to a different woman).  A number of his sons, most notable Carlos García Velez&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubagenweb.org/mil/mambi/generals.htm Infos at the Cuban Genealogy Center website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Granma&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.granma.cubaweb.cu/secciones/comentarios/nacional-02.htm Article] on ''[[Granma (newspaper)|Granma]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and Calixto Enamorado,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spanamwar.com/calixtoenamorado.htm Infos on the Spanish American War Centennial website]&lt;/ref&gt; fought in his armies.

==War record==
Around the age of 18, taking after his grandfather, García joined with a Cuban uprising which became the first war of independence [[Ten Years' War]].  García fought against Spanish colonial rule for five years until his capture.  Far from his troops, protected only by a small detail who soon lay dead or dying around him, Garcia in an attempt to avoid giving the Spanish the satisfaction of his seizure shot himself under the chin with a .45 caliber pistol. Although the bullet went out of his forehead and knocked him unconscious, he survived; the wound, which left a great scar, gave him headaches for the rest of his life. When the Spanish authorities came to Holguín to inform Calixto's mother, Lucía Iñíguez, she said that wasn't her son, when the officials explained to her Calixto tried to commit suicide she replied that was her son, ''&quot;first dead than captured!&quot;'' He was imprisoned until the [[Pact of Zanjón]] and the end of the Ten Years' War, was signed in 1878.  García travelled to Paris and New York between imprisonments. In keeping to his quest, García joined with [[Maceo]] in the [[Little War (Cuba)|Little War]] from 1879 to 1880 as well as the 1895 [[Cuban War of Independence|War for Independence]]. He, and separately at least three sons, escaped Spain and arrived with a well supplied expedition in 1896. In that last conflict he succeeded Maceo, once his subordinate in the [[Ten Years' War]], as the second in command in the Cuban Army.

[[Image:Calixto García and William Ludlow in Cuba, 1898.jpg|thumb|García with American brigadier general [[William Ludlow]] at the time of the landing of the American army in Cuba]]

This General had a long string of victories in this war including the taking of Tunas and Guisa, and the emotionally significant re-occupation of Bayamo.  García made liberal use of spies to prepare his attack, these include [[Dominador de la Guardia]] father of [[Ángel de la Guardia]] and María Machado, illegitimate daughter of Spanish General [[Emilio March]] who helped prepare the taking of Tunas; [[Frederick Funston]] later US Major General and José Martí y Zayas Bazán son of [[José Martí]] the major Cuban National Hero directed artillery; [[Mario García Menocal]] a to be president of Cuba was wounded in a principal assault. Angel de la Guardia, also a major Cuban national hero died in this battle on August 30, 1897.&lt;ref name=Granma/&gt;

At the time of the U.S. landings, García, with skilled use of mobile artillery, controlled the interior of old Oriente Province, and prepared the landing places for the U.S. Army near Santiago.  His troops effectively supported the Marine forces at Guantanamo who, once out of range of the guns of the {{USS|Marblehead|C-11|6}}, had difficulty dealing with Spanish ''guerrilla'' tactics. He was the general who dealt with the American troops and joined them in military actions, only to be denied entrance into Santiago de Cuba when the Spaniards surrendered.

==Death==
García died of pneumonia on December 11, 1898, at the age of 59, while on a diplomatic mission in Washington, D.C. He was buried temporarily in [[Arlington National Cemetery]] in the U.S., then transported on the heavily armed seagoing war ship {{USS|Nashville|PG-7|6}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/events/spanam/ships/gbt-lg.htm Infos on the Naval Historical Centre website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/rblume.htm Article] on [[Arlington National Cemetery]] website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeofheroes.com/e-books/mohW_spanam/page_12.html Infos at homeofheroes.com]&lt;/ref&gt; to Cuba.  His final burial in Cuba was preceded by a number of emotional incidents, and his statues and busts are found throughout Cuba.  A major statue is found on the [[Malecon, Havana|Malecon]] near the [[US Interests Section in Havana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cubatravels.net/Ingles/Descripciones/RVedadoIing.htm Infos at cubatravels.net]&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, a large bronze tablet prominently inscribed with the phrase &quot;[[Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori]]&quot; was erected by the Masons at the place of his demise—the Raleigh Hotel in Washington, D.C.  Today, this tablet resides at the private residence of one of Gen. García's direct descendants.

The essay &quot;[[A Message to Garcia]]&quot; by [[Elbert Hubbard]] was written in reference to U.S. intelligence officer Andrew Rowan's successful mission, against great odds, to establish contact with García early in the Spanish-American War. According to language expert Charles Earle Funk, &quot;to take a message to Garcia&quot;, meaning to accept an extremely difficult challenge, was a popular U.S. slang expression for years. The essay was made into two American films, the 1916 silent ''[[A Message to Garcia (1916 film)|A Message to Garcia]]'' with Garcia played by [[Charles Sutton]] and the 1936 film ''[[A Message to Garcia (1936 film)|A Message to Garcia]]'' featuring [[Enrique Acosta]].

In 1976, a municipality in [[Holguín Province]] was named [[Calixto Garcia, Cuba|Calixto Garcia]] for him. His portrait is on the 50 [[Cuban peso]] banknote.

Today you can find out about Calixto García's son's granddaughter who still lives, Kathleen Garcia. when we interviewed her she said 'I still remember the stories my grandfather would say about his father'. I can remember it like it was yesterday' she said. although many people know her they have never known how much history is in her Cuban family. One of the interviews was very sentimental to her, she said with a low tone of voice 'though my  great grandfather is not with us he will be with us but in our hearts forever no matter what'! and that was the last we heard of her when she then left our stage very sentimental and we never saw her again, except her friends but they don't know the history that lives on in her family.

[[File:Moa iceshelves.jpg|thumb|300px|Some Antarctic iceshelves.]]

The '''Larsen Ice Shelf''' is a long, fringing [[ice shelf]] in the northwest part of the [[Weddell Sea]], extending along the east coast of [[Antarctic Peninsula]] from [[Cape Longing]] to the area just southward of [[Hearst Island]]. Named for Captain [[Carl Anton Larsen]], the master of the Norwegian whaling vessel ''[[Jason (ship)|Jason]]'', who sailed along the ice front as far as 68°10' South during December 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{gnis|type=antarid|8534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In finer detail, the Larsen Ice Shelf is a series of three shelves that occupy (or occupied) distinct embayments along the coast. From north to south, the three segments are called Larsen A (the smallest), Larsen B, and Larsen C (the largest) by researchers who work in the area. The Larsen A ice shelf disintegrated in January 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=scientists-trek-collapsing-glaciers-antarctica-meltdown Scientists Trek to Collapsing Glaciers to Assess Antarctica’s Meltdown and Sea-Level Rise] July 16, 2012 [[Scientific American]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Larsen B ice shelf disintegrated in February 2002. The Larsen C ice shelf appeared to be stable in 2008, though scientists predict that, if localized warming continues at its current rate, the shelf could disintegrate at some point within the foreseeable future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cires.colorado.edu/science/pro/irp/2008/scambos/ Larsen C thinning]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Larsen disintegration events were unusual by past standards. Typically, ice shelves lose mass by [[iceberg]] [[Ice calving|calving]] and by melting at their upper and lower surfaces. The disintegration events are linked to the ongoing [[Climate of Antarctica#Climate change|climate warming]] in the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], about 0.5&amp;nbsp;°C per decade since the late 1940s, which is a consequence of localized warming of the Antarctic peninsula.&lt;ref name=&quot;Connor2005&quot;&gt;Connor, Steve (2005) &quot;Ice shelf collapse was biggest for 10,000 years since Ice Age&quot; ''The Independent,'' London (Aug 4), [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/ice-shelf-collapse-was-biggest-for-10000-years-303492.html online]&lt;/ref&gt; This localized warming is caused by [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[global warming]], according to some scientists through strengthening of the [[Antarctic annular winds]].&lt;ref&gt;Marshall et al., [http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI3844.1 &quot;The Impact of a Changing Southern Hemisphere Annular Mode on Antarctic Peninsula Summer Temperatures&quot;], ''Journal of Climate'', '''vol. 19''', pp. 5388–5404, October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

During 31 January 2002–7 March 2002 the Larsen B sector collapsed and broke up, 3,250&amp;nbsp;km² of ice 220&amp;nbsp;m thick, covering an area comparable to the US state of [[Rhode Island]], disintegrated and collapsed in one season.&lt;ref name=Hulbe&gt;Hulbe, Christina (2002) &quot;Larsen Ice Shelf 2002, warmest summer on record leads to disintegration&quot;, website of Portland State University, [http://web.pdx.edu/~chulbe/science/Larsen/larsen2002.html online]&lt;/ref&gt; Larsen B was stable for up to 12,000 years, essentially the entire [[Holocene]] period since the last glacial period, according to [[Queen's University]] researchers.&lt;ref name=Queens&gt;Press Release (2005) &quot;Ice Shelf disintegration threatens environment, Queen's study&quot; Queens University, Kingston, Ontario, [http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2005-08/qu-isd080305.php online] on [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]'s Eurekalert&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, Larsen A &quot;was absent for a significant part of that period and reformed beginning about 4,000 years ago,&quot; according to the study.

Despite its great age, the Larsen B was clearly in trouble at the time of the collapse. With warm currents eating away the underside of the shelf, it had become a &quot;hotspot of global warming.&quot;&lt;ref name=Pearce&gt;Pearce, Fred (2006) ''The Last Generation: How Nature Will Take Her Revenge for Climate Change'', Eden Project Books, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; What especially surprised glaciologists was the speed of the breakup, which was a mere three weeks (or less). A factor they had not anticipated was the powerful effects of liquid water; ponds of meltwater formed on the surface during the near 24 hours of daylight in the summertime, then the water flowed down into cracks and, acting like a multitude of wedges, levered the shelf apart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nsidc.org/iceshelves/larsenb2002/ Larsen B Ice Shelf Collapses in Antarctica]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2001/14.html Antarctic Ice Shelf Collapse Triggered By Warmer Summers] Office of News Services, [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], Jan. 16, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Global increase in air temperature was not the only factor contributing to the break according to [[Ted Scambos]], of the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]]'s national snow and ice data centre.

The collapse of Larsen B has revealed a thriving [[Cold_seep#Chemosynthetic_communities|chemotrophic ecosystem]] 800&amp;nbsp;m (half a mile) below the sea. &quot;Despite near freezing and sunless conditions, a community of clams and [[microbial mat]]s are flourishing in undersea [[sediment]]s. [...] The discovery was accidental. [[U.S. Antarctic Program]] [[scientist]]s were in the northwestern Weddell Sea investigating the sediment record in a deep glacial trough twice the size of [[Texas]]. [[Methane]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]] associated with [[cold seep]]s is suspected as the source of the chemical energy powering the ecosystem. The area had been protected by the overlying ice sheet from debris and sediment which was seen to be building up on the white microbial mats after the breakup of the ice sheet. The clams were observed clustered about the vents.&lt;ref name=Eos&gt;{{cite journal|last=Domack|first=Eugene|coauthors=Scott Ishman, Amy Leventer, Sean Sylva, Veronica Willmott, Bruce Huber|title=A Chemotrophic Ecosystem Found Beneath Antarctic Ice Shelf|journal=Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union|date=19 July 2005|volume=86|issue=29|doi=10.1029/2005EO290001|url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2005/2005EO290001.shtml|accessdate=July 19, 2012|publisher=American Geophysical Union|bibcode = 2005EOSTr..86..269D }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Studies show that in the middle of the present [[interglacial]] the former Larsen A region, which was the furthest north and outside the Antarctic Circle, had previously broken up and reformed only about 4,000 years ago, although the former Larsen B had been stable for at least 10,000 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Queens&quot; /&gt; The maximal ice age on the current shelf dates from only two hundred years ago.

{{Main|Eosin}}
'''Eosinophilic''' (Greek suffix [[-phil-]], meaning ''loves eosin'') refers to the [[stain]]ing of certain [[Biological tissue|tissues]], [[cell (biology)|cells]], or [[organelle]]s after they have been washed with [[eosin]], a [[dye]].  

Eosin is an [[acidic]] dye; thus, the structure being stained is [[Acidic (chemistry)|basic]].

Eosinophilic describes the appearance of cells and structures seen in [[histological section]]s that take up the staining dye [[eosin]]. This is a bright-pink dye that stains the cytoplasm of cells, as well as extracellular proteins such as [[collagen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chop.edu/service/center-for-pediatric-eosinophilic-disorders/about-eosinophilic-disorders.html About Eosinophilic Disorders]. Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Accessed March 2nd, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Such eosinophilic structures are, in general, composed of [[protein]].

The stain eosin is usually combined with a stain called [[hematoxylin]] to produce a hematoxylin and eosin-stained [[histological section|section]] (also called an [[H&amp;E stain]], HE or H+E section). This is the most widely used histological stain in medical diagnosis; for example, when a [[pathologist]] examines a [[biopsy]] of a suspected cancer, the biopsy will have been stained with H&amp;E.

Some structures seen inside cells are described as being eosinophilic, for example, [[Lewy body|Lewy bodies]], [[Mallory body|Mallory bodies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/eosinophilicdisorders.html Eosinophilic]. Medline Plus. Accessed March 2nd, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some cells are also described as eosinophilic, such as [[Leukocytes]].&lt;ref name=Dixon&gt;{{cite book|last=Dixon|first=Frank J.|title=Advances in Immunology, Volume 39|year=1986|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=&lt;!--0120224399, --&gt;9780120224395|pages=323|url=http://books.google.com.uy/books?id=GXpByqkfZNcC&amp;dq=eosinophilic&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Dugattyus szelep.png|thumb|right|Piston valve in a [[brass instrument]]]]

A ''''piston valve'''' is a device used to control the motion of a [[fluid]] along a [[tubing (material)|tube]] or [[pipe (material)|pipe]] by means of the [[linear]] motion of a [[piston]] within a chamber or [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]].

Examples of piston valves are:
* The valves used in many [[brass instrument]]s
* The valves used in [[Spud gun|pneumatic cannons]]
* The valves used in many stationary [[steam engine]]s and [[steam locomotive]]s

==Brass instruments==
[[File:Trompette - premier piston - montage perspective.jpg|thumb|upright|A trumpet's piston valve]]

Cylindrical piston valves called Perinet valves (after their inventor [[François Perinet]]) are used to change the length of tube in the playing of most [[brass instrument]]s, particularly the trumpet-like members of the family ([[cornet]], [[flugelhorn]], [[saxhorn]], etc.).

Other brass instruments use [[rotary valve]]s, notably the orchestral [[horn (instrument)|horn]]s and many [[tuba]] models, but also a number of rotary-valved variants of those brass instruments which more commonly employ piston valves.

The first piston-valved musical instruments were developed just after the start of the 19th century. The Stölzel valve (invented by [[Heinrich Stölzel]] in 1814) was an early variety. In the mid 19th century the [[Vienna valve]] was an improved design. However most professional musicians preferred rotary valves for quicker, more reliable action, until better designs of piston valves were mass manufactured towards the end of the 19th century.

==Pneumatic cannon==
A piston valve can also refer to a 2-way 2-position, pilot-operated [[spool valve]]. The term is extremely popular among [[spud gun]] enthusiasts who often build homemade piston valves for use in pneumatic cannon. Valves are typically constructed primarily from pipe fittings and machined plastics or metals.
The inside of a piston valve contains a piston that blocks the output when the valve is pressurized, and a volume of air behind the piston. When the pressure behind the piston is released the piston is pushed back by the force of the pressure from the input. This allows the valve to be opened by a much smaller pilot valve, with speeds faster than possible with just a manually operated valve. Functionally these types of valves are comparable to quick exhaust valves.

This type of piston valve is also sometimes referred to as a back-pressure valve.

[[Image:Basophil.jpg|thumb|A [[Basophil granulocyte]] stains dark purple upon H&amp;E staining.]]
'''Basophilic''' is a technical term used by [[Histology|histologists]]. It describes the microscopic appearance of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s and [[Biological tissue|tissue]]s, as seen down the [[microscope]], after a [[histological section]] has been stained with a [[dye]] attracted to basic molecules. The most common such dye is [[haematoxylin]].

Basophilic describes the appearance of structures seen in histological sections which take up basic dyes. The structures usually stained are those that contain negative charges, such as the phosphate backbone of DNA in the [[cell nucleus]] and [[ribosomes]].

''Basophils'' are cells that &quot;love&quot; the blue, and usually show up deep blue under standard staining techniques ([[H&amp;E]]). Specifically, this term refers to:

* [[basophil granulocyte]]s
* [[anterior pituitary basophil]]s

Different definitions will apply to basophilic:

'''Basophilic stains''' are acidic stains called '''base loving''' stains.  '''Basophilic cells''' are '''base loving''' cells. '''Basophilic cells''' attract base dyes, such as hematoxylin; however, 'Eosin' is referred to as an basophilic stain.

Simplistically, acid pH stains (positive charge) are attracted to the base pH tissue(negative charge), so they are called '''basophilic stains'''.  Eosinophils (base components that like acids) are dyed red by the '''basophilic stain''' or acid stain, eosin.  '''Basophils'''(acid that like base components) are dyed blue by the acidophilic or basic stain, hematoxylin.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Forgoszelep.png|right|frame|airflow of rotary valve in two positions]]

A '''rotary valve''' is a type of [[valve]] in which the rotation of a passage or passages in a transverse plug regulates the flow of liquid or gas through the attached pipes. The common stopcock is the simplest form of rotary valve. Rotary valves have been applied in numerous applications, including:

* Changing the pitch of [[brass instrument]]s.
* Controlling the steam and exhaust ports of [[steam engine]]s, most notably in the [[Corliss steam engine]].
* Periodically reversing the flow of air and fuel across the [[open hearth furnace]].
* Loading sample on [[chromatography]] [[column]]s.
* Certain types of [[two-stroke engine]]s.
* Most hydraulic automotive power steering control valves.

==Use in brass instruments==
[[Image:Rotor valve.svg|thumb|Rotary valve for a double [[Horn (instrument)|horn]]]]
In the context of [[brass instrument]]s, rotary valves are found on [[Horn (instrument)|horns]], [[trumpet]]s, [[trombone]]s, [[flugelhorns]], and [[tuba]]s. Many European [[trumpet]] players tend to favor rotary valves.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Trombone F-attachment valves are usually rotary, with several variations on the basic design also in use, such as the [[Thayer Valve|Thayer axial-flow valve]] and [[Hagmann valve]].

Joseph Riedl is credited with the first use of rotary valves on brass instruments in 1832. 

[[File:Cilindros.JPG|thumb|150px|left|Rotary valves]]{{-}}

==Use in industry==
In industry, a rotary valve (which can also be called airlock) is often used to enter or extract material from two chambers with different pressure level.

As part of the material exchange process, the valve is often used as a measuring or metering device.

==Use in engine design==
[[File:Itala rotary valve strokes.jpg|thumb|[[Itala]] rotary valve engine (1912).]]
[[File:Itala rotary valve cooling.jpg|thumb|[[Itala]] rotary valve cooling (1919).]]
The rotary valve combustion engine possesses several significant advantages over the conventional assemblies, including significantly higher compression ratios and rpm, meaning more power, a much more compact and light-weight cylinder head, and reduced complexity, meaning higher reliability and lower cost. As inlet and exhaust are usually combined special attention should be given to valve cooling to avoid [[engine knocking]].

Rotary valves have been used in several different engine designs. In Britain, the ''National Engine Company Ltd'' advertised its rotary valve engine for use in early aircraft, at a time when [[poppet valve]]s were prone to failure by sticking or burning.&lt;ref&gt;Flight magazine, April 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1930s, [[Aspin valve|Frank Aspin]] developed a design with a rotary valve that rotated on the same axis as the cylinder bore, but with limited success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isdm.co.uk/aspin/index.htm Aspin Rotary Valve Engine] Accessed on 18th Oct 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kawasaki Heavy Industries Motorcycle &amp; Engine|Kawasaki]] and others have also used rotary valves in [[Two-stroke engine#Rotary inlet valve|two-stroke]] motorcycle engines, where the arrangement helps to prevent reverse flow back into the intake port during the compression stroke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freeengineinfo.com/rotary-valve-engine.htm Free engine info] Accessed on 18th Oct 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Austrian engine manufacturer [[Rotax]] used rotary intake valves in their now out-of-production {{convert|64|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Rotax 532]] two-stroke engine design and continues to use rotary intake valves in the 532's successor, the current-production {{convert|64|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Rotax 582]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RotaxOwnersMan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.rotax-aircraft-engines.com/portaldata/5/dokus/d04495.pdf|title = OPERATORS MANUAL FOR ENGINE TYPES 447, 503 &amp; 582|accessdate = 4 January 2011|last = [[Rotax|BRP-Rotax GmbH &amp; Co. KG]]|authorlink = |year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Raisner&quot;&gt;Raisner, William: ''LEAF catlog'', pages 6-105. Leading Edge Airfoils, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; 

US company ''Coates International Ltd'' has developed a spherical rotary valve for internal combustion engines which replaces the [[poppet valve]] system. This particular design is four-stroke, with the rotary valves operated by overhead shafts in lieu of overhead camshafts (i.e. in line with a bank of cylinders). The first sale of such an engine was part of a [[natural gas]] [[engine-generator]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coatesengine.com/index.html Coates International] Accessed on 3rd Mar 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Rotary valves are highly suitable for high reving engines, such as those used in sportscars and F1 racing cars, on which traditional poppet valves with springs can fail due to spring resonance and where the [[desmodromic valve]] gear is too heavy, large in size and too complex to time and design properly. Rotary valves allow for a more compact and lightweight cylinder head design. They rotate at half engine speed and lack the inertia forces of reciprocating valve mechanisms. This allows for higher engines speeds offering appr. 10% more power. The 1980s [[W12_engine#MGN|MGN W12]] F1 engine used rotary valves but never raced. Between 2002 and 2004 the Australian developer ''Bishop Innovation'' and [[Mercedes-Benz HighPerformanceEngines|Mercedes-Ilmor]] tested rotary valves for a F1 V10 engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.people.net.au/~mrbdesign/PDF/AutoTechBRV.pdf |title=The Bishop Rotary Valve (AutoTechnology, Special 2007) |author=Tony Wallis |accessdate=2011-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bishop Innovations' patent for the rotary valve engine was bought out by BRV Pty Ltd, owned by Tony Wallis, one of the valves original designers. BRV has constructed several functional motors using the rotary valve technology, such as a Honda CRF 450, which had greater torque at both low(17% increase) and high (9% increase) engine speeds, and also produced more brake horsepower up to around 30% more at functional engine speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Bishop Rotary Valve|url=http://home.people.net.au/~mrbdesign/PDF/AutoTechBRV.pdf|publisher=AutoTechnology Magazine|accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engine was also considerably smaller and lighter, as the cylinder head assembly was not as large.

==Use in production engines==
UK company ''RCV Engines Ltd'' uses [[Sleeve valve#Modern usage|rotating cylinder liner technology]] as a specialized form of rotary valve in some of their four-stroke [[model engine]] and small-engine line-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcvengines.com/pdf_files/india%20_conference_2004_presentation.pdf |title=RCV Engines Ltd - UK (India – AutoExpo 2004) |author=RCV |accessdate=2012-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcvengines.com/pdf_files/saepaper.pdf |title=The Rotating Cylinder Valve 4-stroke Engine (SAE Paper 2002-32-1828) |author=Keith Lawes |accessdate=2012-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ACV also use horizontal and vertical rotary valves in four-stroke engines in their current range of engines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rcvengines.com/technology_verticalrotatingvalve.html&lt;/ref&gt;

RCV have developed a 125cc rotating cylinder liner engine, incorporating a rotating valve in the cylinder liner, for scooter applications.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rcvengines.com/applications_engine_development.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[PGO Scooters]] of Taiwan were working with RCV in developing the engine for their applications.&lt;ref&gt;http://green.autoblog.com/2008/10/23/pgo-working-on-rotary-valve-scooter-engine/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in chromatography==
Rotary valves are used for loading samples on columns used for liquid or gas chromatography. The valves used in these methods are usually 6-port, 2-position rotary valves.

A '''volume''' is a term in [[data compression]] for a file that has been compressed and split into different parts.

There are two advantages in having a [[compression utility]] with the ability for compression into volumes.  First, it allows an individual to download the file in segments at his or her own pace.  As well if there is a corruption only one volume is affected instead of the whole—which can be corrected using [[parity file]]s.  Second, it allows compression to a volume size compatible with removable media.  For example, compressing a backup into 700MB chunks for easy storage on [[CD-R]]s.

The '''cimbasso''' is a [[brass instrument]] in the [[trombone]] family, with a sound ranging from warm and mellow to bright and menacing. It has three to five [[piston valve|piston]] or [[rotary valve]]s, a predominantly cylindrical [[bore (wind instruments)|bore]], and is usually pitched in F or B{{music|flat}}. It is in the same range as a [[tuba]] or a contrabass trombone.

The modern instrument can be played by a tubist or a bass trombonist.

[[Image:Cimbasso in F.jpg|framed|&quot;Bent&quot; cimbasso]]

==History==
The modern cimbasso is most commonly used in [[opera]] scores by [[Giuseppe Verdi]] from ''[[Oberto]]'' to ''[[Aida]]'', and by [[Giacomo Puccini]] in ''[[Le Villi]]'' only, though the word also appears in the score of [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'', which premiered in 1831. In addition to opera orchestras, the cimbasso can be commonly heard in motion picture soundtracks.

The early use of &quot;cimbasso&quot; referred to an upright [[Serpent_(musical_instrument)|serpent]] of a narrower bore than the &quot;basson russe&quot;, usually made of wood with a brass bell.  Later, this term had a more generic meaning referring to a range of instruments including the [[ophicleide]], valved ophicleide, and other instruments.  In general, after the advent of the more conical bass tuba, the term was more used to refer to a more blending voice than the &quot;basso tuba&quot; or &quot;bombardone,&quot; and began to imply the lowest trombone.  Verdi, who at times specified a preference for the blending timbre of a low trombone over the heavier sounding tuba, developed an instrument with the firm Pelliti, which was a contrabass trombone in BB{{music|flat}} wrapped in tuba form.

The instrument had also been featured on [[Korn]]'s Unplugged concert with MTV.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Antarctica Map.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of Antarctica, with Wilkes Land slightly to the right]]

'''Wilkes Land''' is a large district of land in eastern [[Antarctica]], formally claimed by [[Australia]] as part of the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]], though the validity of this claim has been placed for the period of the operation of the [[Antarctic Treaty]], to which Australia is a signatory. It fronts on the southern [[Indian Ocean]] between [[Queen Mary Coast]] and [[Adélie Land|Adelie Land]], extending from [[Cape Hordern]] in 100°31'&amp;nbsp;E to [[Pourquoi Pas Point]], in 136°11'&amp;nbsp;E. The region extends as a [[Circular sector|sector]] about 2600&amp;nbsp;[[kilometre|km]] towards the [[South Pole]], with an estimated land area of 2,600,000&amp;nbsp;km², mostly glaciated. It is further subdivided in the following coastal areas which can also be thought of as sectors extending to the South Pole:

# [[Knox Land]]: 100°31'&amp;nbsp;E to 109°16'&amp;nbsp;E
# [[Budd Land]]: 109°16'&amp;nbsp;E to 115°33'&amp;nbsp;E
# [[Sabrina Land]]: 115°33'&amp;nbsp;E to 122°05'&amp;nbsp;E
# [[Banzare Land]]: 122°05'&amp;nbsp;E to 130°10'&amp;nbsp;E
# [[Clarie Land]]: (Wilkes Coast) 130°10'&amp;nbsp;E to 136°11'&amp;nbsp;E

In a wider sense, Wilkes Land extends further East to [[Point Alden]] in 142°02'&amp;nbsp;E, thereby including [[Adélie Land|Adelie Land]], which is claimed by France.

==Name==
Wilkes Land is named after Lieutenant [[Charles Wilkes]] (later a Rear Admiral), the American explorer who commanded the 1838–42 [[United States Exploring Expedition, 1838-1842|United States Exploring Expedition]]. The naming is in recognition of Wilkes' discovery of the [[continental margin]] over a distance of 2,400&amp;nbsp;[[kilometre|km]] (1,500&amp;nbsp;[[mile]]s) of coast, thus providing substantial proof that [[Antarctica]] is a [[continent]]. This definition of extent excludes the area east of 142°02'&amp;nbsp;E, [[George V Land]], which was sighted by Wilkes but has been shown by later expeditions to be further south than the positions originally assigned by him.

==Geology==
In 2006 a team of researchers led by [[Ralph von Frese]] and [[Laramie Potts]] used gravity measurements by NASA's [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment|GRACE]] satellites to discover the 300-mile-wide [[Wilkes Land crater]], which probably formed about 250 million years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;crater&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/erthboom.htm| title=Big Bang in Antarctica — Killer Crater Found Under Ice| publisher=Research News| first=Pam Frost| last=Gorder| date=June 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wilkes Land in popular culture==
* Wilkes Land is featured prominently in the 1998 film ''[[The X-Files (film)|The X-Files]]''. Fox Mulder journeys to [[Antarctica]] to save his partner [[Dana Scully]], who is being held there against her will. In the process discovering a huge secret lab under the surface run by the [[Cigarette-Smoking Man]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">In mathematical [[group theory]], the '''Schur multiplier''' or '''Schur multiplicator''' is the second [[group homology|homology group]] ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''G'', '''Z''') of a group ''G''. It was introduced by {{harvs|txt|first=Issai|last=Schur|authorlink=Issai Schur|year=1904}} in his work on [[projective representation]]s.

==Examples and properties==
The Schur multiplier M(''G'') of a finite group ''G'' is a finite [[abelian group]] whose [[Periodic group|exponent]] divides the order of ''G''.  If a [[Sylow subgroup|Sylow ''p''-subgroup]] of ''G'' is cyclic for some ''p'', then the order of M(''G'') is not divisible by ''p''. In particular, if all [[Sylow subgroup|Sylow ''p''-subgroups]] of ''G'' are cyclic, then  M(''G'') is trivial.

For instance, the Schur multiplier of the [[nonabelian group of order 6]] is the [[trivial group]] since every Sylow subgroup is cyclic.  The Schur multiplier of the [[elementary abelian group]] of order 16 is an elementary abelian group of order 64, showing that the multiplier can be strictly larger than the group itself.  The Schur multiplier of the [[quaternion group]] is trivial, but the Schur multiplier of [[dihedral group|dihedral 2-groups]] has order 2.

The Schur multipliers of the finite [[simple group]]s are given at the [[list of finite simple groups]].  The [[covering groups of the alternating and symmetric groups]] are of considerable recent interest.

{{anchor|Schur cover}}

==Relation to projective representations==
[[File:Projective-representation-lifting.svg|225px|thumb|A [[projective representation]] of ''G'' can be pulled back to a [[linear representation]] of a [[central extension (mathematics)|central extension]] ''C'' of ''G.'']]

Schur's original motivation for studying the multiplier was to classify [[projective representation]]s of a group, and the modern formulation of his definition is the second [[group cohomology|cohomology group]] ''H''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''G'', '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;×&lt;/sup&gt;).  A projective representation is much like a [[group representation]] except that instead of a homomorphism into the [[general linear group]] GL(''n'', '''C'''), one takes a homomorphism into the [[projective general linear group]] PGL(''n'', '''C''').  In other words, a projective representation is a representation modulo the [[center of a group|center]].

{{harvs|last=Schur|author1-link=Issai Schur|txt|year=1904|year2=1907}} showed that every finite group ''G'' has associated to it at least one finite group ''C'', called a '''Schur cover''', with the property that every projective representation of ''G'' can be lifted to an ordinary representation of ''C''.  The Schur cover is also known as a '''covering group''' or '''Darstellungsgruppe'''.  The Schur covers of the [[list of finite simple groups|finite simple groups]] are known, and each is an example of a [[quasisimple group]].  The Schur cover of a [[perfect group]] is uniquely determined up to isomorphism, but the Schur cover of a general finite group is only determined up to [[isoclinism]].

==Relation to central extensions==
The study of such covering groups led naturally to the study of [[central extension (mathematics)|central]] and '''stem extensions'''.

A [[central extension (mathematics)|central extension]] of a group ''G'' is an extension
:1 → ''K'' → ''C'' → ''G'' → 1
where ''K'' ≤ Z(''C'') is a [[subgroup]] of the [[center (group theory)|center]] of ''C''.

A '''stem extension''' of a group ''G'' is an extension
:1 → ''K'' → ''C'' → ''G'' → 1
where ''K'' ≤ Z(''C'') ∩ ''C''′ is a subgroup of the intersection of the center of ''C'' and the [[derived subgroup]] of ''C''; this is more restrictive than central.&lt;ref&gt;Rotman (1994) p.553&lt;/ref&gt;

If the group ''G'' is finite and one considers only stem extensions, then there is a largest size for such a group ''C'', and for every ''C'' of that size the subgroup ''K'' is isomorphic to the Schur multiplier of ''G''.  If the finite group ''G'' is moreover [[perfect group|perfect]], then ''C'' is unique up to isomorphism and is itself perfect.  Such ''C'' are often called '''universal perfect central extensions''' of ''G'', or '''covering group''' (as it is a discrete analog of the [[universal covering space]] in topology).  If the finite group ''G'' is not perfect, then its Schur covering groups (all such ''C'' of maximal order) are only [[isoclinic]].

It is also called more briefly a '''universal central extension''', but note that there is no largest central extension, as the [[direct product of groups|direct product]] of ''G'' and an [[abelian group]] form a central extension of ''G'' of arbitrary size.

Stem extensions have the nice property that any lift of a generating set of ''G'' is a generating set of ''C''.  If the group ''G'' is [[presentation of a group|presented]] in terms of a [[free group]] ''F'' on a set of generators, and a [[normal subgroup]] ''R'' generated by a set of relations on the generators, so that ''G'' ≅ ''F''/''R'', then the covering group itself can be presented in terms of ''F'' but with a smaller normal subgroup ''S'', ''C'' ≅ ''F''/''S''.  Since the relations of ''G'' specify elements of ''K'' when considered as part of ''C'', one must have ''S'' ≤ [''F'',''R''].

In fact if ''G'' is perfect, this is all that is needed: ''C'' ≅ [''F'',''F'']/[''F'',''R''] and M(''G'') ≅ ''K'' ≅ ''R''/[''F'',''R''].  Because of this simplicity, expositions such as {{harv|Aschbacher|2000|loc=§33}} handle the perfect case first.  The general case for the Schur multiplier is similar but ensures the extension is a stem extension by restricting to the derived subgroup of ''F'': M(''G'') ≅ (''R'' ∩ [''F'', ''F''])/[''F'', ''R''].  These are all slightly later results of Schur, who also gave a number of useful criteria for calculating them more explicitly.

==Relation to efficient presentations==
In [[combinatorial group theory]], a group often originates from a [[presentation of a group|presentation]].   One important theme in this area of mathematics is to study presentations with as few relations as possible, such as one relator groups like [[Baumslag-Solitar group]]s.  These groups are infinite groups with two generators and one relation, and an old result of Schreier shows that in any presentation with more generators than relations, the resulting group is infinite.  The borderline case is thus quite interesting: finite groups with the same number of generators as relations are said to have a [[deficiency (group theory)|deficiency]] zero.  For a group to have deficiency zero, the group must have a trivial Schur multiplier because the minimum number of generators of the Schur multiplier is always less than or equal to the difference between the number of relations and the number of generators, which is the negative deficiency.  An ''[[efficient group]]'' is one where the Schur multiplier requires this number of generators.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson &amp; Robertson (1979) pp.275–289&lt;/ref&gt;

A fairly recent topic of research is to find efficient presentations for all finite simple groups with trivial Schur multipliers.  Such presentations are in some sense nice because they are usually short, but they are difficult to find and to work with because they are ill-suited to standard methods such as [[Todd–Coxeter algorithm|coset enumeration]].

==Relation to topology==
In [[topology]], groups can often be described as finitely [[presentation of a group|presented]] groups and a fundamental question is to calculate their integral homology ''H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''(''G'', '''Z''').  In particular, the second homology plays a special role and this led [[Heinz Hopf|Hopf]] to find an effective method for calculating it.  The method in {{harv|Hopf|1942}} is also known as '''Hopf's integral homology formula''' and is identical to Schur's formula for the Schur multiplier of a finite group:

:&lt;math&gt; H_2(G, \mathbf{Z}) \cong (R \cap [F, F])/[F, R]&lt;/math&gt;

where ''G'' ≅ ''F''/''R'' and ''F'' is a free group. The same formula also holds when ''G'' is a perfect group.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg (1994) Theorems 4.1.3, 4.1.19&lt;/ref&gt;

The recognition that these formulas were the same led [[Samuel Eilenberg|Eilenberg]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane|Mac Lane]] to the creation of [[cohomology of groups]].  In general, 
:&lt;math&gt;H_2(G, \mathbf{Z}) \cong  \bigl( H^2(G, \mathbf{C}^\times) \bigr)^* &lt;/math&gt; 
where the star denotes the algebraic dual group. Moreover when ''G'' is finite, there is an [[Natural transformation|unnatural]] isomorphism 
:&lt;math&gt;\bigl( H^2(G, \mathbf{C}^\times) \bigr)^* \cong H^2(G, \mathbf{C}^\times).&lt;/math&gt;

The Hopf formula for ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''G'')  has been generalised to higher dimensions. For one approach and references see the paper by Everaert, Gran and Van der Linden listed below. 

A [[perfect group]] is one whose first integral homology vanishes.  A [[superperfect group]] is one whose first two integral homology groups vanish.  The Schur covers of finite perfect groups are superperfect.  An [[acyclic group]] is a group all of whose reduced integral homology vanishes.

==Applications==
The [[Algebraic K-theory#K2|second algebraic K-group]] K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') of a commutative ring ''R'' can be identified with the second homology group ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''E''(''R''), '''Z''') of the group ''E''(''R'') of (infinite) [[elementary matrix|elementary matrices]] with entries in ''R''.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg (1994) Corollary 4.2.10&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail''' is a 29.5-mile (47.2-kilometre) hiking trail that descends from the ridge of the [[Santa Cruz Mountains]] in Northern [[California]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]], passing through [[Castle Rock State Park (California)|Castle Rock State Park]] and [[Big Basin Redwoods State Park]]. Big Basin is California's first state park. It contains beautiful waterfalls and some of the largest, tallest, and oldest Redwood forests left in existence.

The trail usually takes two to three days to complete, with nearly all thru-hikers traveling from East to West (towards the ocean). It is possible to walk the entire trail in one day, though this is unusual and very difficult. However, there is a 50-km (31-mi) ultra running race held on this trail one or two times per year. Many hikers like to take a detour up Berry Creek Trail to see the waterfalls or to camp at Sunset Trail Camp, adding an additional {{convert|2.7|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the hike. 

[[File:Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail 2.jpg|left|thumb|Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail 2|The Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail passing through a stand of [[California Redwood]] trees.]]
The trail begins at [[Saratoga Gap]] on the ridge, at the intersection of [[California State Route 9|SR 9]] and Skyline Boulevard ([[California State Route 35|SR 35]]). It parallels SR 9 through Castle Rock, crosses the highway, and then follows [[California State Route 236|SR 236]] to Big Basin park headquarters. It then descends through Big Basin, following [[Waddell Creek]] to its outlet at [[Waddell Beach]].

[[Santa Cruz Metro]] routes 35 and 40 formerly went from Big Basin State Park Headquarters to Waddell Creek and back. Since September 2011 Route 40 no longer goes all the way to Waddell Beach&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scmtd.com/en/metro-news-bulletins METRO News Bulletins page]&lt;/ref&gt; but instead turns around at Cement Plant Rd. Route 35 only stops at the Headquarters on the weekends during the Spring/Summer season.

There is a proposed plan for a &quot;Saratoga-to-the-Sea&quot; Trail. [http://www.svcn.com/archives/saratoganews/20040114/sn-news4.shtml] The plan would create a trail starting somewhere near [[Hakone Gardens]] in [[Saratoga, California|Saratoga]], passing through a defunct [[quarry]], and terminating in [[Sanborn-Skyline County Park]]. This trail would connect to the Skyline-to-the-Sea Trail via a completed section of the [[Bay Area Ridge Trail]]. The quarry is owned by the Santa Clara County Roads and Airports Department, which is conducting feasibility studies of this plan. [http://www.svcn.com/archives/saratoganews/20060510/news1.shtml]

[[File:Mcmurdo sound USGS map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|McMurdo Sound, Antarctica]]
'''McMurdo Sound''' and its ice-clogged waters extends about {{convert|55|km|mi}} long and wide. The sound connects the [[Ross Sea]] to the north with the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] cavity to the south via [[Haskell Strait, Antarctica|Haskell Strait]]. The strait is largely covered by the [[McMurdo Ice Shelf]]. The [[Royal Society Range]] rises from sea level to {{convert|4205|m|ft}} on the western shoreline. [[Ross Island]], an historic jumping-off point for polar explorers, designates the eastern boundary. The [[Volcano#Active|active volcano]] [[Mt Erebus]] at {{convert|3794|m|ft}} dominates Ross Island. [[Antarctica]]'s largest scientific base, the United States' [[McMurdo Station]], as well as the [[New Zealand]] [[Scott Base]] are located on the southern shore of the island. Less than 10 percent of McMurdo Sound's shoreline is free of ice.&lt;ref name=&quot;elliott&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|volume=61 |pages=68–76 |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1745-7939.2005.00005.x |author=Christine Elliott |title=Antarctica, Scott Base and its environs |journal=New Zealand Geographer |date=May 2005 |accessdate=23 May 2007 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-7939.2005.00005.x | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain [[James Clark Ross]] discovered this sound, which is about {{convert|1300|km|mi}} from the South Pole, in February 1841, and he named it after Lt. [[Archibald McMurdo]] of the [[HMS Terror (1813)|HMS ''Terror'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;nsf&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/stis1994/nsf92134/nsf92134.txt| work=National Science Foundation |title=NSF 92-134 Facts about the US Antarctic Program |date=7 November 1994 | accessdate=23 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sound today serves as a resupply route for [[cargo ship]]s and for [[airplane]]s that land on the floating ice [[airstrip]]s near the McMurdo Station. However, McMurdo Station’s continuous occupation by [[human being]]s since 1957-58 has [[water pollution|dirtied]] the harbor of [[Winter Quarters Bay]].

The pack ice that girdles the shoreline at Winter Quarters Bay and elsewhere in the sound presents a formidable obstacle to surface ships. Vessels require ice-strengthened hulls and often have to rely upon escort by [[icebreaker]]s. Such extreme sea conditions have limited access by tourists, who otherwise are appearing in increasing numbers in the open waters of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. The few tourists who reach the McMurdo Sound find spectacular scenery with wildlife to be seen, including [[killer whale]]s, [[Pinniped|seal]]s, [[Adelie penguin]]s, and [[Emperor penguin]]s.

Cold circumpolar currents of the [[Southern Ocean]] reduce the flow of warm South Pacific or South Atlantic waters reaching McMurdo Sound and other Antarctic coastal waters. Bitter [[katabatic wind]]s spilling down from the [[Antarctic]] polar plateau into McMurdo Sound demonstrate Antarctica's status as the coldest and windiest continent in the world. The McMurdo Sound freezes over with sea ice about {{convert|3|m|ft}} thick during the winter. The Antarctic summer causes the pack ice to break up. Wind and currents may push the ice northward into the Ross Sea, stirring up cold bottom currents that spill into the ocean basins of the world. Temperatures during the dark winter months at McMurdo Station have dropped as low as {{convert|-51|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. However, December and January are the warmest months, with average highs at {{convert|-1|°C|°F|abbr=on}} and {{convert|-1|°C|°F|abbr=on}} respectively, according to USA Today.

==Ice defines strategic role==
McMurdo Sound's role as a strategic waterway dates back to early 20th century Antarctic exploration. British explorers [[Ernest Shackleton]] and [[Robert Falcon Scott|Robert Scott]] built bases on the sound's shoreline as jumping-off points for their overland expeditions to the [[South Pole]].

McMurdo Sound's logistic importance continues today. Aircraft transporting cargo and passengers land upon frozen runways at [[Williams Field]] located on the McMurdo Ice Shelf. Moreover the annual sealift of a cargo ship and fuel tanker rely upon the sound as a supply route to the continent's largest base at [[McMurdo Station]]. Both the U.S. base and New Zealand's nearby [[Scott Base]] are located on the southern tip of [[Ross Island]].

[[Ross Island]] is the southmost piece of land in Antarctica that is accessible by ship. In addition, the harbor at McMurdo's Winter Quarters Bay is the world's southmost [[seaport]] (Department of Geography, Texas A&amp;M University). The access by ships depends upon favorable ice conditions.

McMurdo Sound during austral winter presents a virtually impenetrable expanse of surface ice. Even during summer, ships approaching McMurdo Sound are often blocked by various concentrations of first-year ice, [[fast ice]] (connected to the shoreline), and hard multi-year ice. Subsequently, icebreakers are required for maritime resupply missions to [[McMurdo Station]]. Nonetheless, ocean currents and fierce Antarctic winds can drive pack ice north into the [[Ross Sea]], temporarily producing areas of open water. {{-}}

==Iceberg B-15A clogs McMurdo Sound==
[[File:B15 landsat.jpg|thumb|An iceberg that [[Ice calving|calved]] off [[Iceberg B-15]] caused extensive pack ice buildup in McMurdo Sound, blocking shipping and preventing penguin access to open water.]]A common event of previously unseen dimensions occurred on the [[Ross Ice Shelf]] in 2000 that wreaked havoc at McMurdo Sound more than five years later. The {{convert|282|km|mi|sing=on}} long [[Iceberg B-15]], the largest ever seen at the time, broke off from the Ross Ice Shelf in March 2000 (Antarctic Climate &amp; Ecosystems: Cooperative Research Center). Then, on 27 October 2005, B-15 suddenly broke up.

Research based upon measurements retrieved from a [[seismometer]] previously placed on B15 indicated that ocean swells caused by an earthquake {{convert|13000|km|mi}} away in the [[Gulf of Alaska]] caused the breakup, according to a report by the U.S. National Public Radio.&lt;ref name=&quot;npr&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6204027 |title=Alaskan Storm Plays Role of Butterfly for Antarctica |author=Richard Harris |work=National Public Radio |date=5 October 2006 |accessdate=23 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wind and sea currents shifted a smaller but still massive Iceberg B-15A towards McMurdo Sound. B-15A's enormous girth temporarily blocked the outflow of pack ice from McMurdo Sound, according to news reports.

Iceberg B-15A's grounding at the mouth of McMurdo Sound also blocked the path for thousands of penguins to reach their food source in open water. Moreover, pack ice built up behind the iceberg in the [[Ross Sea]] creating a nearly {{convert|150|km|nmi|sing=on}} frozen barrier that blocked two cargo ships en route to supply McMurdo Station, according to the [[National Science Foundation]].

[[Image:MV American Tern at McMurdo Sound.jpg|thumb|left|MV ''American Tern'' bringing supplies for McMurdo Station]]
The [[icebreaker]] [[USCGC Polar Star]] and the Russian [[Krasin (1976 icebreaker)|Krasin]] were required to open a ship channel through ice up to {{convert|3|m|ft}} thick. The last leg of the channel followed a route along the eastern shoreline of McMurdo Sound adjacent to [[Ross Island]]. The icebreakers escorted the tanker USNS Paul Buck to McMurdo Station's ice pier in late January. The freighter [[MV American Tern|MV ''American Tern'']] followed on 3 February.

Similar pack ice blocked a National Geographic expedition aboard the {{convert|34|m|ft|sing=on}} Braveheart from reaching B-15A. However, expedition divers were able to explore the underwater world of another grounded tabular iceberg. They encountered a surprising environment of fish and other sea life secreted within a deep iceberg [[crevasse]]. Discoveries included starfish, crabs, and ice fish. The latter were found to have burrowed thumb-sized holes into the ice.

The expedition reported an exceedingly rare and seldom witnessed occurrence of an iceberg exploding. Shards of ice erupted into the air as if a bomb went off, this only hours after divers surfaced and after the Braveheart moved away from the iceberg (National Geographic).&lt;ref name=&quot;sptimes&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/040101/Pasco/In_search_of_a_monste.shtml |title=Aboard the Braveheart: In search of a monster iceberg |author=Jennifer Goldblatt |work=St. Petersburg Times (Florida) |date=1 April 2001| accessdate=23 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Winds have far reaching effects==
[[File:Iceberg B-15A weather instrument.jpg|thumb|Weather instruments such as this device installed upon Iceberg B-15A provide scientists a better understanding of Antarctica's impact upon global climate. Photograph by: Josh Landis. National Science Foundation]]Polar winds are a driving force behind weather systems arising from three surface zones that converge at McMurdo Sound: the polar plateau and [[Transantarctic Mountains]], the Ross Ice Shelf, and the Ross Sea. These surface zones create a range of dynamic weather systems. Cold, heavy air descending rapidly from the polar plateau at elevations of {{convert|3000|m|ft}} or more spawns fierce katabatic winds. These dry winds can reach hurricane force by the time they reach the Antarctic coast. Wind instruments recorded Antarctica’s highest wind velocity at the coastal station Dumont d'Urville in July 1972 at {{convert|320|km/h|mi/h}} (Australian Government Antarctica Division).

Prevailing winds spilling into McMurdo Sound shoot between mountain passes and other land formations, stirring up blizzards known locally as &quot;Herbies&quot;. Such blizzards can occur any time of year. Residents of McMurdo Station and Scott Base have dubbed the nearby [[White Island (Ross Archipelago)|White Island]] and [[Black Island (Ross Archipelago)|Black Island]] as Herbie Alley due to winds that funnel blizzards between the islands (Field Manual for the U.S. Antarctic Program).

Overall the continent’s extreme cold air scarcely holds enough moisture for snowfall. Consequently, Antarctica’s blizzards are at times as much about wind stirring up existing snow as they are about new snowfall. For instance, the water equivalent from annual snow fall on Ross Island averages only {{convert|17.6|cm|in}} (National Science Foundation). Snowfall in Antarctica's interior is far less at {{convert|5|cm|in}}. Noted as well are the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]] on the western shores of McMurdo Sound where snow seldom accumulates.

Antarctica's shortfall in new snow does not lessen the continent's striking polar climate. Antarctica essentially doubles in size during the winter as the surrounding sea water freezes (Antarctic Connection). The subsequent annual summer melt of the estimated {{convert|18000000|km2|mi2}} of ice that rings Antarctica creates the planet's largest seasonal climate event (USA Today). The result is a vertical circulation driven by a massive heat and energy exchange between ice, ocean, and atmosphere.

McMurdo Sound provides an important component in Antarctica's global effects upon climate. A key factor is the polar winds that can drive the sound's pack ice into the Ross Sea summer or winter. Frigid katabatic winds rake subsequent exposed water causing sea ice to form. Freezing surface water excludes salt from the water below; leaving behind heavy, cold water that sinks to the ocean floor. This process repeats itself along Antarctica's coastal areas, spreading cold sea water outward into the world's ocean basins (Australian Government Antarctic Division).

According to an interview with a climatologist Gerd Wendler published in the National Science Foundation’s Antarctic Sun, one could dive to the ocean floor anywhere in the world and encounter water from the coast of Antarctica. &quot;Seventy five percent of all the bottom water, wherever you are, comes from Antarctica.&quot;

==Life below the ice==
[[File:Jellyfish méduse diver mcmurdo.jpg|thumb|A research diver reaches towards a jellyfish that thrives in the {{convert|-1.5|C|F}} salt water of McMurdo Sound.]]
A rich sea life thrives under the barren expanse of McMurdo Sound's ice pack. For example, frigid waters that would kill many other fish in the world sustain the Antarctic [[Notothenioidei|notothenioids]], a bony &quot;ice fish&quot; related to walleyes and perch. The notothenioids feature an [[Antifreeze protein]] in their bloodstream that prevents them from freezing. Notothenioids account for more than 50 percent of the number of fish species in the Antarctic coastal regions and 90 to 95 percent of the biomass, according to the National Academy of Sciences for the United States.

What some sea creatures lack in numbers, they make up for in their visual presentation. McMurdo Sound divers encounter colorful examples of sea life, including bright yellow cactus sponges and green globe sponges. [[Starfish]], [[sea urchin]]s, and [[sea anemone]]s are also present. The latter is noted for its wispy tentacles. Large [[sea spider]]s inhabit the deeps of the sound and feed on sea anemone, whereas swarms of [[Antarctic krill]] flourish in the upper depths of the icy waters. The shrimp-like krill is a key species in the Southern Ocean food chain for sea life ranging from the [[baleen whale]] to penguins. The sound is also home to [[soft coral]], whose flexible form allows the creature to bend so as to feed off the ocean floor, according to the “Underwater Field Guide to Ross Island &amp; McMurdo Sound.”

[[File:Underwater mcmurdo sound.jpg|thumb|left|Underwater photo showing the diverse animal life in McMurdo Sound, including the scallop ''[[Adamussium colbecki]]'', sea urchin ''[[Sterechinus neumayeri]]'', sea sponge ''[[Homaxinella balfourensis]]'', brittlestar ''[[Ophionotus victoriae]]'' and sea spider ''[[Colossendeidae|Colossendeis]]'']]
Antarctic [[penguins]], famous for their waddling walk on surface ice, transform themselves into graceful and powerful swimmers underwater. The [[Emperor Penguin]]s’ pursuit of [[squid]], fish, and crustaceans leads them to dive as deep as {{convert|500|m|ft}}. However, the Emperor can go deeper. Scientists have found that the penguin can reach {{convert|600|m|ft}} for short durations. The much smaller [[Adelie Penguin]] is less ambitious. It feeds underwater for up to two minutes at a maximum depth of {{convert|170|m|ft}} (Underwater Field Guide to Ross Island &amp; McMurdo Sound).

The [[Weddell Seal]] out-dives even the Emperor Penguin. The seal can hold its breath for up to 80 minutes and reach a depth of {{convert|700|m|ft}} (Underwater Field Guide to Ross Island &amp; McMurdo Sound). Scientists diving in McMurdo also encounter the [[Leopard Seal]], and [[Crabeater Seal]]. The many-storied Leopard seal is a ferocious predator that preys on warm-blooded animals, such as other seals and penguins, whereas the more sedate crabeater uses its unusual multilobed teeth to sieve krill from the water.

Seals have a natural enemy in the orca or [[killer whale]] of McMurdo Sound. The killer whale's voracious appetite leads it to consume up to {{convert|227|kg|lb}} of food daily. The orcas feature black and white coloring, a large dorsal fin up to {{convert|1.8|m|ft}}, and enormous strength and size (males can be {{convert|8|m|ft}}). The whales travel in pods of up to 30 individuals and can swim up to {{convert|46|km/h|mi/h}}. (&quot;Underwater Field Guide to Ross Island &amp; McMurdo Sound.&quot;)

==Seascape reveals human impact==
[[File:Tanker bateau citerne mcmurdo sound.jpg|thumb|The tanker USNS ''Lawrence N. Gianella'' on standby at Winter Quarters Bay near McMurdo Station. Photograph by: Peter Rejcek. National Science Foundation.]]More than 50 years of continuous operation of the United States and New Zealand bases on Ross Island have left pockets of severe pollution marring McMurdo Sound's pristine environment. Until 1981, [[McMurdo Station]] residents simply towed their garbage out to the sea ice and let nature take its course. The garbage sank to the sea floor when the ice broke up in the spring, according to news reports.&lt;ref name=&quot;frozen&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=The world's frozen clean room |work=Business Week |date=22 January 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2001 survey of the seabed near McMurdo revealed 15 vehicles, 26 shipping containers, and 603 fuel drums, as well as some 1,000 miscellaneous items dumped on an area of some {{convert|20|ha|acre}}. Findings by scuba divers were reported in the State of the Environment Report, a New Zealand sponsored study.&lt;ref name=&quot;radford&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://environment.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,,1829739,00.html |author=Tim Radford | title=Thaw puts husky hazards in the path of Scott's successors |work=The Guardian |date=17 November 2001| accessdate=23 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;enn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enn.com/archive.html?id=24782&amp;cat=archives |title=Antarctic sea floor contaminated by human waste near bases |author=Ray Lilley |date=18 November 2001 | accessdate=23 May 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070926235303/http://enn.com/archive.html?id=24782&amp;cat=archives &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=26 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study by the government agency [[Antarctica New Zealand]] revealed that decades of daily pumping thousands of gallons of raw sewage from 1,200 summer residents into the sound had fouled Winter Quarters Bay, the harbor at McMurdo. The pollution ended in 2003 when a $5 million waste treatment plant went online.&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15834019/page/5/ |title=Reflections from time on the Ice |publisher=MSNBC |date=4 December 2006| accessdate=23 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other documented bay water contaminants include leakage from an open dump at the station. The dump introduced heavy metals, petroleum compounds, and chemicals into the water.&lt;ref name=enn/&gt;

Zoologist Clive Evans from Auckland University described McMurdo's harbor as &quot;one of the most polluted harbors in the world in terms of oil&quot;, according to a 2004 article by the New Zealand Herald.

Modern operations in McMurdo Sound have sparked surface cleanup efforts, recycling, and exporting trash and other contaminates by ship. The U.S. National Science Foundation began a 5-year, $30-million cleanup program in 1989, according to Reuters News Agency.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;U.S. Antarctic Base at McMUrdo Sound a Dump; Environment: Trashing began in last century with the start of exploration. The waste are is fenced off to slow the escape of wind-blown rubbish&quot;, Reuters. December 29, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; The concentrated effort targeted the open dump at McMurdo. By 2003, the U.S. Antarctic Program reported recycling approximately 70% of its wastes, according to Australia’s Herald Sun.

[[File:ErebusIceTongue ASTER 30nov2001.jpg|thumb|left|The Erebus Ice Tongue near the ship channel used during annual resupply missions to [[McMurdo Station]] (NASA)]]
The 1989 cleanup included workers testing hundreds of barrels at the dump site, mostly full of fuels and human waste, for identification prior to being loaded onto a freighter for exportation. The precedent for exporting wastes began in 1971. The United States shipped out tons of radiation-contaminated soil after officials shut down a small nuclear power plant.&lt;ref&gt;Antarctic dump leaks waste&quot;, Courier Mail. 20 March 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet the very ships involved in supporting the export of McMurdo Station’s waste present pollution hazards themselves. A study by the Australian Institute of Marine Science found that anti-fouling paints on the hulls of icebreakers are polluting McMurdo Sound.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Toxic chemicals from ice-breaking ships are polluting Antarctic seas&quot;, New Scientist. 22 May 2004. This article cites a study by the Australian Institute of Marine Science, which was slated to be published in the Marine Pollution Bulletin.&lt;/ref&gt; Such paints kill algae, barnacles, and other marine life that adhere to ship hulls. Scientists found that samples taken from the ocean floor contained high levels of tributyltin (TBT), a component of the anti-fouling paints. &quot;The levels are close to the maximum, you will find anywhere, apart from ship grounding sites&quot;, said Andrew Negri of the institute.

Ships, aircraft, and land-based operations in McMurdo Sound all present hazards of oil spills or fuel leaks. For instance, in 2003, the build-up of two years of difficult ice conditions blocked the U.S. tanker MV Richard G. Matthiesen from reaching the harbor at McMurdo Station, despite the assistance of icebreakers. Instead shore workers rigged a temporary {{convert|5.6|km|mi|sing=on}} fuel line over the ice pack to discharge the ship’s cargo. The ship pumped more than {{convert|23|e6L|e6gal|abbr=off}} of fuel to storage facilities at McMurdo.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;NSF chooses alternative method to refuel its main Antarctic research station; Unusual, multi-year ice conditions keep tanker out of McMurdo Station&quot;, M2 Presswire. 27 February 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Officials balance the potential for fuel spills inherent in such operations against the critical need to keep [[McMurdo Station]] supplied with oil. A fuel tank spill in an unrelated onshore incident in 2003 spilled roughly {{convert|25000|L|gal|abbr=off}} of [[diesel fuel]] at a [[helicopter]] pad at McMurdo Station.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Antarctic Research: Station recharged by ship via miles of fule lines, Science Letter via NewsRx.com and NewsRx.net. 17 March 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The 1989 grounding of the [[Argentinean]] ship Bahia Paraiso and subsequent spillage of {{convert|640000|L|gal|abbr=off}} of oil into the sea near the Antarctic Peninsula showed the environmental hazards inherent in supply missions to Antarctica.&lt;ref name=frozen&gt;&quot;The world's frozen clean room&quot;, Business Week. 22 January 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tourism surge yet to reach McMurdo==
[[File:Mont mount Erebus Kaiser.jpg|thumb|Most visitors to Antarctica's frozen landscape arrive via ship-borne cruises.]]
Antarctica's extreme remoteness and hazardous travel conditions limit Antarctica tourism to an expensive niche industry largely centered on the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. The number of seaborne tourists grew fourfold during the 1990s, reaching more than 14,000 by 2000, up from 2,500 ten years earlier.&lt;ref name=toursim&gt;&quot;Is rise in tourism helping Antarctica or hurting it?&quot;, Travel Watch; National Geographic Traveler. 22 August 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 46,000 airborne and seaborne tourists visited Antarctica during the 2007–2008 season, according to the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators (IAATO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.iaato.org/tourism_stats.html| title=IAATO Tourism Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This confederation of tour operators reports that only 5% of Antarctic tourists visit the [[Ross Sea]] area, which encompasses McMurdo Sound. Tourists congregate on the ice-free coastal zones during summer near the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. The peninsula's wildlife, soaring mountains, and dramatic seascapes have drawn commercial visitors since the late 1950s, when Argentina and Chile operated cruises to the [[South Shetland Islands]] (Science and Stewardship in the Antarctic: Commission on Geosciences, Environment, and Resources. 1993).

Tourists flights began in 1957, when a Pan American [[Boeing 377 Stratocruiser]] made the first civilian flight to Antarctica. Commercial flights landed at McMurdo Sound and the [[South Pole]] in the 1960s. Routine over-flights from Australia and New Zealand took place between 1977 and 1980, transporting more than 11,000 passengers, according to New Zealand Antarctica, which manages [[Scott Base]]. One such flight, [[Air New Zealand Flight 901]], crashed into [[Mount Erebus]] on the eastern shores of McMurdo Sound. The crash high on the slopes of the active volcano took the lives of all 257 people aboard the aircraft.

In 1969 the [[MS Explorer]] brought seagoing tourists to Antarctica (British Antarctic Survey). The cruise’s founder, [[Lars-Eric Lindblad]], coupled expeditionary cruising with education. He is quoted as saying, &quot;You can't protect what you don't know&quot; (IAATO). In the decades since the Lindblad, ships engaged in Antarctic sight-seeing cruises have grown in size and number.

[[File:Hoisting a Zodiac.jpg|thumb|left|A Zodiac inflatable is hoisted aboard an expedition cruise ship in Antarctic waters after ferrying passengers to shore.]]
Infrequent Antarctic cruises have included passenger vessels carrying up to 960 tourists (IAATO). Such vessels may conduct so-called &quot;drive-by&quot; cruises with no landings made ashore.

The Russian [[Kapitan Khlebnikov (icebreaker)]] has conducted voyages to the [[Weddell Sea]] and [[Ross Sea]] regions since 1992. High-latitude cruises in dense pack ice are only achievable during the summer season, November into March. In 1997, the vessel Kapitan Khlebnikov claimed the distinction of being the first ship to circumnavigate Antarctica with passengers (Quark Expeditions). Passengers aboard the icebreaker make landings aboard inflatable zodiacs to explore remote beaches. Their itinerary may also include stops at Ross Island's historic explorer huts at Discovery Point near [[McMurdo Station]] or Cape Royds (Antarctica New Zealand). Additionally, the Russian icebreaker extends the reach of tourism by launching helicopter trips from its decks, including visits to sites such as the [[McMurdo Dry Valleys]] and areas noted for wildlife viewing.

The Spirit of Enderby has been conducting cruises to the [[Ross Sea]] region for many years, including McMurdo Sound. Although the Enderby has an ice-strengthened hull, the ship is not an [[icebreaker]]. The Enderby sports zodiac boats, a [[hovercraft]] for Antarctica voyages, and all-terrain vehicles for over ice or overland travel. Land-based tourism in [[Antarctica]], however, continues to be rare. [[Antarctica]] lacks a permanent land-based tourism facility, despite the annual surge in the number of visitors.

The International Association of Tour Operators (IAATO) has established voluntary standards to discourage tourists from disrupting wildlife. Nonetheless, large ships, carrying more than 400 passengers, may spend up to 12 hours transporting tourists to and from breeding sites. Such large-ship operations expose wildlife to humans far longer than smaller vessels.&lt;ref name=&quot;toursim&quot;/&gt;

[[File:The centre of Marchmont.JPG|thumb|280px|Centre of Marchmont]]
'''Marchmont''' is a mainly residential affluent area of [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]. It lies roughly a mile to the south of the [[Old Town, Edinburgh|Old Town]], separated from it by [[The Meadows (park)|The Meadows]] and [[Bruntsfield Links]]. To the west it is bounded by [[Bruntsfield]]; to the south-southwest by [[Greenhill, Edinburgh|Greenhill]] and then [[Morningside, Edinburgh|Morningside]]; to the south-southeast by [[Grange, Edinburgh|The Grange]]; and to the east by [[Sciennes]]. 

==History==
[[File:Marchmont Road tenements, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Marchmont Road]]
The whole area was developed as a planned middle-class [[Tenement#Scotland|tenement]]s suburb by Sir George Warrender, the owner of Bruntsfield House and the surrounding estate (also known as the &quot;Warrender Park&quot;)  in the mid 19th century. The original feuing plan laid out by architect David Bryce in 1869 called for mainly terraced villas, with a number of large, detached villas on Marchmont Road. However, this was superseded by a later plan that proposed all buildings were four or five-storey tenements. The name Marchmont was originally only used to refer to Marchmont Crescent, Road and Street, but is now used for the whole area. The Warrender name has been retained in the streets Warrender Park Crescent, Road, and Terrace, and also in the Warrender Swim Centre, traditionally known as Warrender Baths.

The buildings are almost exclusively four-storey tenements. The earlier [[Victorian era|Victorian]] buildings are mostly pink [[sandstone]] in a form of [[Scottish baronial style]], by architects such as [[Edward Calvert (architect)|Edward Calvert]], while the later Victorian and [[Edwardian]] buildings are often in blonde sandstone, and in a plainer, more uniform style.

Originally, the area was not allowed to have any premises selling alcohol, {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and although that is no longer the case, there are only a small number of licensed premises. As of mid 2008, the Earl of Marchmont was refurbished and reopened. Other licensed premises include the Argyle Bar, The Hide and the Links Hotel. There are also a number of [[off-license]]d shops.

==Today==
[[File:Warrender Park Road, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|300px|Warrender Park Road, Marchmont]]
Due to its proximity to the city centre, the presence of local amenities, and generally being considered a pleasant area, it is considered a fairly desirable location to live in. This is reflected in high house prices, though these are now typical of most of Edinburgh.  It is highly popular with students, with both [[Edinburgh University]] and [[Napier University]] within easy walking distance.  There is a certain friction between permanent residents and temporary ones (many of whom are students), with the ''Marchmont Action Group Promoting Initiatives for the Environment'' (MAGPIE) unsuccessfully [[petition]]ing the [[Scottish Parliament]] to impose quotas on shared accommodation by restricting the number of Houses of Multiple Occupation Licences (HMO’s) granted for the area.

The area is home to the mosaic-tiled [[listed building|B-listed]] [[Warrender Baths|Warrender Swim Centre]], opened in 1887 and recently restored.

[[James Gillespie's High School]] has been in its present building in Marchmont since the 1960s.  However an extensive rebuilding programme has started that will see the existing school demolished, in stages, and a new school built on the existing site.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/info/20101/schools-buildings/1230/james_gillespies_schools_campus/1&lt;/ref&gt; Local churches include St. Catherine's-Argyle and Marchmont St. Giles &amp;mdash; both [[Church of Scotland]]. Both host various community activities including a [[Pre-school playgroup|playgroup]].

==Marchmont in fiction==
Arden Street is home to [[Ian Rankin]]'s fictional [[Detective Inspector John Rebus]]. (The author himself lives in nearby [[Merchiston]], although he did reside on Arden Street at one point.)

The once ''James Gillespie's High School for Girls'' on Warrender Park Crescent was the school attended by [[Muriel Spark]], and the lead character (and school) in her book, ''[[The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (novel)|The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie]]'' are said to be very closely based on her experiences there.

Pat McGregor from the 44 Scotland Street series by [[Alexander McCall Smith]] also lives in Spottiswoode Street for a time in ''[[Love Over Scotland]]''.

'''USS ''Simpson'' (FFG-56)''' is an [[Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate|''Oliver Hazard Perry''-class]] guided missile [[frigate]] of the [[United States Navy]], named for [[Rear Admiral]] [[Rodger W. Simpson]]. She is currently responsible to Commander, [[Destroyer Squadron 14]] (COMDESRON 14).

==History==
''Simpson'' was laid down a [[Bath Iron Works]], [[Maine]], on 27 February 1984, launched on 31 August 1984 sponsored by Mrs. Gloria Fowles-Simpson&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maritimequest.com/warship_directory/us_navy_pages/frigates/pages/simpson_ffg_56_data.htm Maritime Quest].&lt;/ref&gt; widow of Rodger W. Simpson and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 21 September 1985&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nvr.navy.mil/nvrships/details/FFG56.htm NVR] lists commissioning as 20 September 1985 while [http://www.simpson.navy.mil/site%20pages/history.aspx Ships history page] lists 21 September 1985. DoD image captions such as [[:Image:USS Simpson (FFG-56) during commissioning.jpg]] list 9 November 1985 leading some websites to use that date for commissioning.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], Cmdr. H. Wyman Howard Jr. in command. The ship was delivered 13 September 1985. BIW plans called for delivery to occur 9 August 1985, but that date slipped due to an extended strike at Bath Iron Works that began 30 June 1985.&lt;ref&gt;''BATH IRON STRIKERS TAKING A HARD LINE''; John Milne, Globe Staff. Boston Globe. Boston, Mass.: 27 August 1985. pg. 37&lt;/ref&gt; ''Simpson'' was homeported at [[Naval Station Newport]] until switching to [[Naval Station Norfolk]] on 31 March 1994. ''Simpson'' moved to [[Naval Station Mayport]] in July 2001.&lt;ref name=factfile&gt;Commander, Naval Surface Force, Atlantic. [http://www.cnsl.surfor.navy.mil/Fact%20FIles/SIMPSON.pdf Simpson].&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1986, ''Simpson'' participated in search and recovery operations following the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]].&lt;ref name=factfile/&gt;

Beginning January 1988, ''Simpson'''s first overseas deployment was to the [[Persian Gulf]] as part of [[Operation Earnest Will]], to escort reflagged [[Kuwait]]i oil tankers during the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. On 17 April 1988, ''Simpson'' took part in [[Operation Praying Mantis]], the U.S. response to the mining of the [[frigate]] {{USS|Samuel B. Roberts|FFG-58|2}}, which hit an Iranian M-08 [[Naval mine|mine]] on 14 April 1988.

On 18 April, ''Simpson'', along with {{USS|Wainwright|CG-28|2}}  and {{USS|Bagley|FF-1069|2}}, destroyed [[Iran]]ian naval and intelligence facilities on the oil platform Sirri in the Persian Gulf. Later that day, the ships encountered the Iranian Kaman Class (Combatte II type) missile patrol boat ''[[Joshan]]'', which launched a [[Boeing Harpoon|Harpoon missile]]. ''Simpson'' immediately returned missile fire, striking ''Joshan'' in her superstructure. ''Joshan'' was then sunk by combined gunfire. ''Simpson'' was awarded the [[Joint Meritorious Unit Award]] and the [[Combat Action Ribbon]] for this operation, and the [[Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal]] for the deployment.

''Simpson'' is one of two&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://navysite.de/ffg/FFG56.HTM|title=USS SIMPSON (FFG 56)|publisher=Naval Surface Force Atlantic|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; presently commissioned ships in the US Navy to have sunk an enemy vessel with her shipboard weaponry (as opposed to aircraft).  The other is the {{USS|Constitution}}.&lt;ref&gt;USS Constitution Timeline. US Navy. http://www.ussconstitution.navy.mil/historyupdate.htm (Retrieved 1 June 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s===
20 February 1990, ''Simpson'' rescued 22 crew members from MV ''Surf City'', a reflagged Kuwaiti tanker carrying $9 million in [[naphtha]] and gas oil. ''Surf City'' was transiting near the Iranian island of [[Abu Musa]] when it exploded killing two and forcing the crew to abandon ship. According to Central Command, ''Simpson'' was not escorting the tanker, but was monitoring its progress from {{convert|3|nmi|km}} away and responded immediately to rescue the crew.&lt;ref&gt;Captain and Massachusetts Man Die in Persian Gulf Blast; Mary Curtius, Globe Staff and Tina Cassidy, Contributing Reporter. Boston Globe. Boston, Mass.: 23 February 1990. pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The fire was so intense that US ships could not approach it and ''Surf City'' would burn for two weeks. At the time it was feared to be the result of an attack or a mine, but the [[NTSB]] later determined it to be an accident.&lt;ref&gt;NTSB. [http://www.ntsb.gov/recs/letters/1992/M92_22_24.pdf Safety Recommendation M-92-22 through −24]. 29 April 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1992, during ''Simpson''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s third deployment, ''Simpson'' and {{USS|Normandy|CG-60}} escorted {{USS|America|CV-66}} and two supply ships into the Persian Gulf. At the time, Iraq was refusing to comply with UN weapons inspection and the ships departed the Persian Gulf in early April after inspections resumed.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. CARRIER STIRS TENSION IN GULF; MARK THOMPSON – Knight-Ridder News Service.

Seattle, Wash.: 1 April 1992. pg. a.2&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1993 on ''Simpson''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s fourth deployment she was again assigned to escort [[Carrier Strike Group 6|Carrier Group Six]] with ''America''. During the deployment ''Simpson'' participated in [[Operation Deny Flight]] and [[Operation Provide Promise]] in the [[Adriatic Sea]] and supported [[Operation Continue Hope]] off [[Somalia]]. ''Simpson'' returned to homeport in February 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;Navysite&quot;&gt;Navysite.de [http://www.navysite.de/ffg/FFG56.HTM FFG-56]. History.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NORFOLK-BASED CARRIER HEADING TO SOMALI COAST. Richmond Times – Dispatch. Richmond, Va.: 28 October 1993. pg. B-4&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1994, ''Simpson'' was one of the ships enforcing United Nations sanctions on Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patrol Craft to Tighten Haiti Embargo; Shallow-Draft Vessels Will Try to Intercept Coastal Traffic; Risk to Navy Personnel Rises. Thomas W. Lippman. The Washington Post (pre-1997 Fulltext). Washington, D.C.: 27 May 1994. pg. a.31&lt;/ref&gt;

''Simpson'' deployed to the Caribbean Sea for [[War on Drugs|counter drug operations]] in late 1994 and again in February 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;Navysite&quot;/&gt;

In November 1995, ''Simpson'' deployed to the Mediterranean joining the [[United States Sixth Fleet]] NATO's [[Standing Naval Force Atlantic]]. ''Simpson'' operated in the [[Adriatic Sea]] enforcing UN arms embargo against Croatia and [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] and participating in [[Operation Sharp Guard]]. ''Simpson'' returned to Norfolk 8 May 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;Navysite&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:USS Simpson (FFG 56) and Algerian frigate El Kirch.jpg|thumb|''Simpson'' and Algerian frigate El Kirch, June 2006, after removal of missile launcher.]]
On 3 January 2006, ''Simpson'' deployed with HSL-42, Det. 9, joining [[Standing NRF Maritime Group 1]] and participated in a number of international naval exercises in the [[North Sea]], [[Norwegian Sea]] and Eastern [[Mediterranean Sea]] returning to Mayport 24 June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Mayport Mirror. [http://www.mayportmirror.com/stories/062906/may_usssimpson001.shtml USS Simpson Is Back In Town]. 29 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 October 2007, ''Simpson'' deployed with HSL-46, Det. 7 and [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] [[Law Enforcement Detachments|Law Enforcement Detachment]] (LEDET) 405, to the eastern Pacific for counter narcotics operations returning April 2008. During the deployment ''Simpson'' captured 16 metric tons of cocaine. On 29 November 2007, ''Simpson'' interdicted a self-propelled semi-submersible (SPSS) capable of carrying 5–8 metric tons of cocaine. The sub was sunk by its crew, but the crew was captured and turned over to [[Colombia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayport Mirror 2008&quot;&gt;Mayport Mirror.

On 17 January 2012, ''Simpson'' deployed to the Sixth Fleet Area of Responsibility, participating in Africa Partnership Station 2012, and Operation Active Endeavor. Ports of call included Funchal, Rota, Casablanca, Dakar, Lagos, Accra, Mindelo, Souda Bay, Sicily, Naples and Praia. She returned to Naval Station Mayport on 17 July 2012.

On 18 September 2013, ''Simpson'' deployed once more to the United States Sixth Fleet Area of Responsibility. 

As of 2013, ''Simpson'' is homeported at [[Naval Station Mayport]], Florida, and is part of Destroyer Squadron 14.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayport Mirror 2008&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.cds14.surfor.navy.mil/default.aspx | title= DesRon 14 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher= [[U.S. Navy]] |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote=

'''''Kick''''' is the sixth studio album by the Australian [[Rock music|rock]] band [[INXS]], released in 1987 by [[Warner Music Group#1980s|WEA]] in Australia, [[Atlantic Records]] in the United States and [[Phonogram Records]] in the United Kingdom on [[CD-DA|Audio CD]], [[Compact Cassette]] and [[Gramophone record]]. As the band's most successful studio album, it is certified six times platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], and spawned four US top 10 singles, &quot;[[New Sensation]]&quot;, &quot;[[Never Tear Us Apart]]&quot;, &quot;[[Devil Inside (INXS song)|Devil Inside]]&quot; and &quot;[[Need You Tonight]]&quot;, the last of which reached the top of the Billboard singles charts. At the 1988 [[MTV Video Music Awards]], the band took home five Moonmen for the &quot;Need You Tonight&quot;/&quot;[[Mediate (song)|Mediate]]&quot; video.

The album was produced by [[Chris Thomas (record producer)|Chris Thomas]] and recorded by David Nicholas in Sydney, Australia and in Paris. The album was mixed by [[Bob Clearmountain]] at [[Air Studios]] in London.

==Background==
After the success of their fifth studio album, ''[[Listen Like Thieves]]'' (1985), and its second single &quot;[[What You Need (song)|What You Need]]&quot; (1986), INXS knew their new material would have to be even better, according to guitarist [[Kirk Pengilly]], &quot;We wanted an album where all the songs were possible singles&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jeff&quot;/&gt; They recorded ''Kick'' in Sydney and Paris, it was produced by [[Chris Thomas (record producer)|Chris Thomas]] again,&lt;ref name=&quot;ARDb&quot;/&gt; but Atlantic Records was not happy with the result, as manager [[Chris Murphy]] remembers:

{{quote|They hated it, absolutely hated it. They said there was no way they could get this music on rock radio. They said it was suited for black radio, but they didn't want to promote it that way. The president of the label told me that he'd give us $1 million to go back to Australia and make another album.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jeff&quot;/&gt;}}

Despite Atlantic's protests, ''Kick'' was released in October 1987 and provided the band with worldwide popularity, it peaked at No.&amp;nbsp;1 in Australia,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kent&quot;/&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;3 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]],&lt;ref name=AMGAlbums/&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;9 in UK,&lt;ref name=&quot;UKCharts&quot;/&gt; and No.&amp;nbsp;15 in Austria.&lt;ref name=&quot;AUTCharts&quot;/&gt; It was an upbeat, confident album that yielded four Top 10 US singles, &quot;[[New Sensation]]&quot;, &quot;[[Never Tear Us Apart]]&quot;, &quot;[[Devil Inside (INXS song)|Devil Inside]]&quot; and No.&amp;nbsp;1 &quot;[[Need You Tonight]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=AMGSingles/&gt; &quot;Need You Tonight&quot; peaked No.&amp;nbsp;2 on the UK charts,&lt;ref name=&quot;UKCharts&quot;/&gt; No.&amp;nbsp;3 in Australia,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kent&quot;/&gt; and No.&amp;nbsp;10 in France.&lt;ref name=&quot;FRACharts&quot;/&gt; They toured heavily behind the album throughout 1987 and 1988. The video for the 1987 INXS track &quot;Mediate&quot; (which played after the video for &quot;Need You Tonight&quot;) replicated the format of Bob Dylan's video for &quot;[[Subterranean Homesick Blues]],&quot; even in its use of apparently deliberate errors. In September 1988 the band swept the MTV Video Music Awards with the video for &quot;Need You Tonight/Mediate&quot; winning in 5 categories.&lt;ref name=BandRoadChronology2/&gt;

During 1989, Hutchence collaborated with [[Ollie Olsen|Ian 'Ollie' Olsen]] on a side project, [[Max Q (Australian band)|Max Q]],&lt;ref name=&quot;McF&quot;/&gt; the two had previously worked together on Lowenstein's film ''Dogs in Space''. The rest of the band also took a break to work on side projects, but soon returned to the studio to record their follow-up album to ''Kick'', which was ''[[X (INXS album)|X]]'' (1990).

''Kick'' has been reissued on numerous occasions. Rhino Entertainment released a remastered reissue with four previously unreleased bonus tracks in 2002. Mercury/Universal reissued the album in 2004 as part of their Deluxe Edition series of albums. The two-disc collection was bolstered by a disc of remixes, B-sides and outtakes. ''Kick'' is the band's best-selling album and [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) certified it as 6&amp;times; Platinum, with sales of six million units, in 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;RIAA&quot;/&gt; According to ''INXS: Story to Story: The Official Autobiography'' (2005) it has sold more than 10 million copies in the US alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bozza&quot;/&gt; 

In March 2010, as part of his [[Record Club]] series where he [[Cover version|covers]] classic albums in their entirety, [[Beck]] released the first video of his cover version of ''Kick'' on his website. The videos were submitted weekly in the same track order as the original release, although the whole album was recorded in just twelve hours on 3 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beck.com/recordclub/ |title=Beck / Record Club |publisher=Beck.com |date= |accessdate=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October, it was listed at No.&amp;nbsp;11 in the book, ''[[100 Best Australian Albums]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODonnell&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | title = [[100 Best Australian Albums]] | last1 = O'Donnell | first1 = John | authorlink1 = John O'Donnell (music journalist) | last2 = Creswell | first2=Toby | authorlink2 = Toby Creswell | last3 = Mathieson | first3 = Craig | authorlink3 = Craig Mathieson | publisher = Hardie Grant Books | date = October 2010 | location = [[Prahran, Victoria|Prahran, Vic]] | isbn = 978-1-74066-955-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allmusic]]'s Steve Huey described the album as &quot;an impeccably crafted pop ''tour de force'', the band succeeding at everything they try&quot;.&lt;ref name=allmusicreview/&gt; [[BBC Online|BBC Music]]'s Cormac Heron reviewed the 2004 deluxe edition, &quot;superfluous second disc notwithstanding, this is a near flawless collection of songs&quot; and felt that the &quot;production still sounds fresh and the song-writing partnership of Hutchence/Farriss wins you over with an anthemic glory&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCReview&quot;/&gt; Australian rock music historian, [[Ian McFarlane]], advises that &quot;it became the band's most enduring release by mixing the hard rock sound of Thieves with a looser approach to dance grooves&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McF&quot;/&gt;

The '''bulge bracket''' comprises the world's largest and most profitable multi-national [[investment banks]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yourdictionary.com/finance/bulge-bracket&lt;/ref&gt; whose investment banking clients are usually large corporations, institutions, and governments. They usually provide both advisory and financing banking services, as well as the sales, [[market maker|market making]], and research on a broad array of financial products including equities, credit, rates, commodities, and their derivatives. They are also heavily involved in the invention of new financial products, such as [[Mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] in the 1980s, [[credit default swaps]] in the 1990s, and today, [[carbon emission trading]] and [[insurance]]-linked products. Bulge bracket firms are usually [[primary dealers]] in US [[treasury securities]]. Bulge bracket banks are also global in the sense that they have a strong presence in all three of the world's major regions: The [[Americas]], [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa|EMEA]], and [[Asia-Pacific]].

The name comes from the way investment banks are listed on the &quot;[[tombstone (financial industry)|tombstone]]&quot;, or public notification of a financial transaction or deal. The bank responsible for control of allocation of securities to investors, known as the '''bookrunning manager''' is listed above the others and on the cover of the prospectus. The font size of the name of this bank, or banks if there are co-bookrunning managers, is larger and it may &quot;bulge&quot; out.

There is often debate over which banks are considered to belong to the bulge bracket. Membership implies prestige, but there are no precise criteria for inclusion, and financial power is transient. Various rankings are often cited, such as [[Thomson Financial League Tables|Thomson Reuters League Tables]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=League Tables |publisher=Thomson Reuters |url=http://www.thomsonreuters.com/business_units/financial/league_tables/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloomberg 20,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/marketsmag/mm_0410_story3.html Bloomberg 20]&lt;/ref&gt; or other [[league table]]s.

== Membership ==

=== Prior to the 2007–8 subprime mortgage crisis ===
The Bulge Bracket firms on [[Wall Street]] prior to late 2007 were, alphabetically: [[Bear Stearns]], [[Citigroup]], [[Credit Suisse]], [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Lehman Brothers]], [[Goldman Sachs]], [[J.P. Morgan Chase]], [[Merrill Lynch]], [[Morgan Stanley]], and [[UBS]].

This list has changed as a result of the 2008 [[subprime mortgage crisis]], with [[Lehman Brothers]] having filed for bankruptcy (later having their core US investment bank acquired by [[Barclays]]), [[Bear Stearns]] collapsed and sold to [[J.P. Morgan Chase]] at $10 per share, [[Merrill Lynch]] being purchased by [[Bank of America]]. [[Barclays]] and [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]] gained Bulge Bracket status after their respective acquisitions.

=== Banks formerly part of the bulge bracket ===

* [[Bear Stearns]], acquired by [[J.P. Morgan Chase]] in March 2008.
* [[Dillon, Read &amp; Co.]], acquired by [[Swiss Bank Corporation]] (eventually '''''[[UBS]]''''') in 1997.
* [[First Boston]], acquired by [[Credit Suisse]] in 1988 and branded [[Credit Suisse First Boston]], later renamed to '''''Credit Suisse'''''.
* [[Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co.]], merged with [[Lehman Brothers]] in 1977, forming Lehman Brothers, Kuhn, Loeb Inc.
* [[Lehman Brothers]], declared [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]] in September 2008. The Asian and European operations were bought by [[Nomura Group|Nomura]]. '''''[[Barclays]]''''' acquired the North American Lehman operations.
* [[Merrill Lynch]], acquired by '''''[[Bank of America]]''''' in September 2008.
* UK's [[Morgan, Grenfell &amp; Co.]], acquired by '''''[[Deutsche Bank]]''''' in 1990, renamed Deutsche Morgan Grenfell until 1999.
* [[Salomon Brothers]], acquired by [[Travelers Group]] (eventually '''''[[Citigroup]]''''') in 1998.

== History  ==

The story of tombstone positions and the term &quot;bulge bracket&quot; is told in the &quot;Tombstones&quot; chapter of ''The House of Morgan'' by [[Ron Chernow]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Tombstone positions were a life-and-death matter for Wall Street firms.  Those in higher layers, or brackets, received larger share allotments, while smaller firms struggled their way upwards.  Within brackets, firms were listed alphabetically.  During the Great Alphabet War of 1976, [[Halsey, Stuart &amp; Co.|Halsey, Stuart]] adopted its parent's name, Bache, just to bootstrap up a few lines in tombstones.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Chernow, &quot;[i]n the late 1960s and early 1970s, the top tier – called the bulge bracket – consisted of [[Morgan Stanley]]; [[First Boston]]; [[Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co.|Kuhn, Loeb]]; and [[Dillon, Read]].&quot;  Morgan Stanley appeared above the other members of the bulge bracket by demanding and receiving the role of syndicate manager.

However, Morgan Stanley &quot;queasily noted the rise of [[Salomon Brothers]] and [[Goldman Sachs]], which were using their trading skills to chip away at the four dominant firms.&quot;  In 1975, to more reflect economic reality, Morgan Stanley &quot;kicked out the fading Kuhn, Loeb and Dillon, Read from the bulge bracket and brought in Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers and Goldman Sachs.&quot; However, Morgan Stanley held onto its policy of appearing first by demanding the role of syndicate manager.  Nevertheless, &quot;[b]y the late 1970s, Morgan Stanley's sole-manager policy was a gilded anachronism.&quot;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For Morgan Stanley, the doomsday trumpet sounded in 1979.  That year, IBM asked the firm to accept Salomon Brothers as co-manager on a $1-billion debt issue needed for a new generation of computers...After much resounding talk, nearly everybody [at Morgan Stanley] voted to defy IBM and demand sole management.  Morgan Stanley was shocked when word came back that IBM hadn't budged in its demand: Salomon Brothers would head the issue, as planned.  It was a landmark in Wall Street history: the golden chains [of Morgan dominance] were smashed.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Key Denson Pittman''' (September 19, 1872 – November 10, 1940) was a [[United States Senator]] from [[Nevada]], serving eventually as its [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President ''pro tempore'']] and its Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Committee on Foreign Relations]]. He was a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]].

==Biography==
===Early years===
Pittman was born in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], in 1872. He had a younger brother [[Vail M. Pittman|Vail]], who would later serve as [[Governor of Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nga.org/cms/home/governors/past-governors-bios/page_nevada/col2-content/main-content-list/title_pittman_vail.html|title= 
Nevada Governor Vail Montgomery Pittman |publisher= National Governors Association
|accessdate= October 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pittman was educated by private tutors and at the [[Southwestern Presbyterian University]] in [[Clarksville, Tennessee]]. He studied law, then later became a lawyer. In 1897, Pittman joined in the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] and worked as a miner until 1901. 

Pittman moved to [[Tonopah, Nevada]], in 1902 and continued the practice of law. He represented Nevada at the [[St. Louis Exposition]], the [[Lewis &amp; Clark Centennial Exposition]], and the [[National Irrigation Congress]].{{cn|date=September 2012}}

===Political career===
[[File:Key Pittman cph.3a02989.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Pittman in 1918.]]

In 1910, he made an unsuccessful run for the Senate. Later, he was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to the Senate in 1913 to fill the vacancy caused by the death of [[George S. Nixon]], and served until his death in 1940. 

Between 1933 and 1940, during the [[Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt]], Pittman was the Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Committee on Foreign Relations]] and a member of the Committee on Territories and the [[United States Senate Committee on Industrial Expositions|Committee on Industrial Expositions]]. In addition, during those years Pittman was also [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate]].

Among his legislation is the [[Conservation movement#Pittman–Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act of 1937|Pittman–Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act of 1937]] which set up a formula for federal sharing of ammunition tax revenue for establishing state wildlife areas.  The program is still in effect.{{cn|date=September 2012}} The [[Key Pittman Wildlife Management Area]] near [[Hiko, Nevada]], which encompasses the Frenchy and Nesbitt Lakes, is named in his honor.

===Death and legacy===
It was rumored for years that Pittman died before his [[United States Senate elections, 1940|final election in 1940]], and that Democratic party leaders kept the body in a hotel bathtub full of ice until he was reelected so Governor [[Edward Carville]], a fellow Democrat, could appoint a replacement. While the rumor was false the truth was, as former Nevada State Archivist Guy Rocha wrote, &quot;just as disreputable&quot;. Pittman suffered a severe [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] just before the election on 5 November, and two doctors told his aides before the election that death was imminent. To avoid affecting the election, the party told the press that the senator was hospitalized for exhaustion and that his condition was not serious. Pittman died on 10 November at the [[Washoe General Hospital]] in [[Reno, Nevada]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rocha200305&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nsla.nevadaculture.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=665&amp;Itemid=418 | title=Myth #88 - Key Pittman on Ice | publisher=State Library and Archives, Department of Administration, State of Nevada | work=Sierra Sage | date=May 2003 | accessdate=3 October 2013 | last1=Rocha | first1=Guy | last2=Myers | first2=Dennis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several pieces of legislation bore his name, including the [[Pittman Act]] of 1918 and the [[Pittman–Robertson Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act]] of 1937.

The Pittman section of the [[Alaska Railroad]], more commonly known today as the community of [[Meadow Lakes, Alaska|Meadow Lakes]] west of [[Wasilla]], was also named for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Anita L.|last2=Ewers|first2=Linda D.|title=Ride Guide to the Historic Alaska Railroad |year=2003 |publisher=TurnAgain Products|location=[[Anchorage]]|isbn= 0939301016 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pittman Road runs north from its intersection with the [[George Parks Highway]] at &quot;downtown&quot; Meadow Lakes.

'''Dougie Vipond''' (born Douglas Vipond, 15 October 1966) is a Scottish musician and television personality. He studied at the [[Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama]], graduating in 1985. He was one of the founding members of Scottish [[soft rock]] / [[pop music|pop]] band, [[Deacon Blue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4043/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Deacon Blue|last=Harris|first=Craig|publisher=[[All Media Group|AMG]]|accessdate=8 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the past eleven years he has hosted [[BBC Scotland|BBC Scotland’s]] sport output on [[Sportscene]], covering a vast range of events from football’s Scottish Cup Finals to Rugby’s [[Calcutta Cup]].

Other sports he’s covered over the years include World Championship Mountain Biking, Three Day Eventing and The Bowls World Championship. He can also be seen covering Scotland’s nightly sports news on [[Reporting Scotland]].

Dougie spent four years reporting for the BBC's Holiday strand and his love of the outdoors has led to him presenting BBC Scotland’s The Adventure Show, an extreme sport series in which he reports from and takes part in a variety of adventure sports and competitions.

He became the new presenter of BBC Scotland’s award winning rural affairs series, [[Landward]] in April 2009.

Vipond has also presented a number of educational films produced by Historic Scotland, such as the film installations at Rothesay Castle and Cardoness Castle.

In 2010 Dougie appeared in the documentary Up A Long Creek, in which he and the comedian [[Fred MacAulay]] kayaked the length of the Caledonian Canal for Sport Relief.

In the same year he fronted the world’s first high definition broadcast of live climbing. The Great Climb, was seen simultaneously across the UK on BBC 2 and the BBC HD Channel and streamed worldwide on the web. This programme won a Scottish BAFTA in the Live Event category.

He recently fronted a sports/health strand for [[The One Show]] on [[BBC One|BBC 1]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''First Pitt the Younger Ministry''' was formed in the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] by [[William Pitt the Younger]] in 1783. In 1800, the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] between Great Britain and [[Ireland]] were accepted by their respective parliaments, creating the new [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], which would be governed by the former [[Parliament of Great Britain]], now the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. Pitt governed this new state for the first month of its existence, until differences with King [[George III]] over [[Catholic Emancipation]] caused him to resign.
==List of Ministers==
===1783 − 1801===
''For the first several days of the ministry, [[George Nugent-Temple-Grenville, 1st Marquess of Buckingham|Lord Temple]] held both the secretaryships of state.''

'''''Crest of a Knave''''' is the sixteenth studio [[album]] by [[United Kingdom|British]] rock band [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], released in 1987.

The album relied more heavily on [[Martin Barre]]'s [[electric guitar]] than the band had since the 1970s. However, several tracks still featured drum machine instead of a live drummer. Keyboardist [[Peter-John Vettese]] was now absent and it was [[Ian Anderson (singer and musician)|Ian Anderson]] who contributed the synth programming. The album sleeve only lists [[Ian Anderson (singer and musician)|Ian Anderson]], [[Martin Barre]] and [[Dave Pegg]] as official band members. The cover was designed by heraldic artist [[Andrew Stewart Jamieson]].

The album was a critical and commercial success. It went on to win the 1988 [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental]], beating the heavily favoured ''[[...And Justice for All (album)|...And Justice for All]]'' ([[Metallica]]) and critics' choice ''[[Nothing's Shocking]]'' ([[Jane's Addiction]]). The award was highly controversial as many did not consider the album or even the band to be hard rock or heavy metal. Under advisement from their manager, no one from the band turned up to the award ceremony, as they were told that they had no chance of winning. In response to the controversy, the band's record label [[Chrysalis Records|Chrysalis]] took out an advert in a British music periodical with the line, &quot;The [[flute]] is a heavy, metal instrument!&quot; In 2007, the win was named one of the 10 biggest upsets in Grammy history by [[Entertainment Weekly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2007| title=Grammy's 10 Biggest Upsets | format=http | work=EW.com | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,1567466_20010834_20010795_0,00.html | accessdate=13 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of ''Crest'' has been compared to that of [[Dire Straits]], in part because Anderson no longer had the vocal range he once possessed (the result of recent throat surgery). Tull's frank treatment of sexuality was unabated, however. The album contains the popular live song &quot;Budapest&quot;, which depicts a backstage scene with a shy local female stagehand.

This album was released simultaneously on LP and on CD, but the vinyl edition did not feature the songs &quot;Dogs in the Midwinter&quot; and &quot;The Waking Edge&quot;. Both tracks appeared on vinyl as B-sides to the singles, though.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], the '''axiom of real determinacy''' (abbreviated as '''AD&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''') is an [[axiom]] in [[set theory]]. It states the following:

:Consider infinite two-person [[Determinacy#Games|game]]s with [[perfect information]]. Then, every game of length [[ordinal number|ω]] where both players choose [[real number]]s is determined, i.e., one of the two players has a [[Determinacy#Winning strategies|winning strategy]].

The axiom of real determinacy is a stronger version of the [[axiom of determinacy]], which makes the same statement about games where both players choose [[integer]]s; it is inconsistent with the [[axiom of choice]]. AD&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; also implies the existence of [[inner model]]s with certain [[large cardinal]]s.

AD&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is equivalent to AD plus the [[axiom of uniformization]].

The '''Spooky Zoo Spectacular''' (or '''Spooky Zoo''' for short) is an annual event at [[Chicago]]'s [[Lincoln Park Zoo]], held around or on [[Halloween]].  The purpose of the event is to provide a safe environment for children, particularly those living in Chicago's lower income neighborhoods, to [[trick or treat]].  The event is attended by 30,000 to 40,000 children each year.

Along with stations throughout the zoo where children can collect candy, the event provides a [[haunted house]], a [[costume]] [[parade]], and costumed entertainers.  It is largely put on by [[volunteer]]s, and supported by a number of local and national businesses.

'''''Man and Technology: A Contribution to a Philosophy of Life''''' is a short [[book]] by [[Oswald Spengler]] discussing a [[critique of technology]] and [[industrialism]].  It was published as ''Der Mensch und die Technik'' in [[Munich]] in 1931.

The principle idea in this work is that many of the [[Western world]]'s great achievements may soon become spectacles for our descendants to marvel at, as we do with the [[pyramids of Egypt]] or the baths of [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Gimpel, Jean. ''The Industrial Revolution of the Middle Ages''. Penguin Books, 1976, p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; In Spengler's mind, our culture will be destroyed from within by [[materialism]], and destroyed by others through [[economic competition]] and [[warfare]].

The '''Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation''' ('''FHLMC'''), known as '''Freddie Mac''', is a public [[government-sponsored enterprise]] (GSE), headquartered in the [[Tyson's Corner, Virginia|Tyson's Corner CDP]] in unincorporated [[Fairfax County, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TysonsMap&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/MapItDrawServlet?geo_id=16000US5179952&amp;_bucket_id=50&amp;tree_id=420&amp;context=saff&amp;_lang=en&amp;_sse=on Tysons Corner CDP, Virginia].&quot; ''[[United States Census Bureau]]''. Retrieved on May 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.freddiemac.com/corporate/about/contactus.htm Contact Us].&quot; ''Freddie Mac''. Retrieved on May 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The FHLMC was created in 1970 to expand the [[secondary market]] for [[Mortgage loan|mortgages]] in the US. Along with other GSEs, Freddie Mac buys mortgages on the secondary market, pools them, and sells them as a [[mortgage-backed security]] to investors on the open market. This [[secondary mortgage market]] increases the supply of money available for mortgage lending and increases the money available for new home purchases.  The name, &quot;Freddie Mac&quot;, is a variant of the [[Acronym and initialism|initialism]] of the company's full name that had been adopted officially for ease of identification (see &quot;GSEs&quot; below for other examples).

On September 7, 2008, [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]] (FHFA) director [[James B. Lockhart III]] announced he had put [[Fannie Mae]] and Freddie Mac under the [[conservatorship]] of the FHFA (see [[Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac]]). The action has been described as &quot;one of the most sweeping government interventions in private financial markets in decades&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ofheo.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=James B.|last=Lockhart III|title=Statement of FHFA Director James B.

[[Moody's]] gave Freddie Mac's preferred stock an investment grade rating of A1 until August 22, 2008, when [[Warren Buffett]] said publicly that both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae had tried to attract him and others. Moody's changed the [[credit rating]] on that day to Baa3, the lowest investment grade credit rating. Freddie's senior debt credit rating remains Aaa/AAA from each of the major ratings agencies Moody's, S&amp;P, and Fitch.&lt;ref name=AP-20080922&gt;{{cite news|title= Freddie Mac courts investors, Buffett passes|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080915032759/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/08/22/business/NA-US-Mortgage-Giants-Crisis.php%7C&lt;!--url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/08/22/business/NA-US-Mortgage-Giants-Crisis.php%7C--&gt;date=August 22, 2008|publisher=Associated Press via International Herald Tribune via Internet Archive|accessdate=&lt;!--2008-09-07--&gt;August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the start of the conservatorship, the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] had contracted to acquire US$1 billion in Freddie Mac senior preferred stock, paying at a rate of 10% per year, and the total investment may subsequently rise to as much as US$100 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Christie, Rebecca|title=Paulson Engineers U.S. Takeover of Fannie, Freddie (Update4)|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=ajcw4yxxPGJ8|date=September 7, 2008|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=2008-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Home loan interest rates may go down as a result and owners of Freddie Mac debt and the Asian central banks who had increased their holdings in these bonds may be protected. Shares of Freddie Mac stock, however, plummeted to about one [[United States dollar|U.S. dollar]] on September 8, 2008, and dropped a further 50% on June 16, 2010, when the Federal Housing Finance Agency ordered the stocks delisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Adler, Lynn|title=Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac to delist shares on NYSE|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE65F3GR20100616|date=June 16, 2010|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2010-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the yield on [[United States Treasury security|U.S Treasury securities]] rose in anticipation of increased U.S. federal debt.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
From 1938 to 1968, the [[Federal National Mortgage Association]] (Fannie Mae) was the sole institution that bought mortgages from depository institutions, principally savings and loan associations, which encouraged more mortgage lending and effectively insured the value of mortgages by the US government. In 1968, Fannie Mae split into a private corporation and a publicly financed institution. The private corporation was still called Fannie Mae and its charter continued to support the purchase of mortgages from savings and loan associations and other depository institutions, but without an ''explicit'' insurance policy that guaranteed the value of the mortgages. The publicly financed institution was named the [[Government National Mortgage Association]] (Ginnie Mae) and it explicitly guaranteed the repayments of securities backed by mortgages made to government employees or veterans (the mortgages themselves were also guaranteed by other government organizations).

To provide competition for the newly private Fannie Mae and to further increase the availability of funds to finance mortgages and home ownership, Congress then established the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) as a private corporation through the [[Emergency Home Finance Act of 1970]]. The charter of Freddie Mac was essentially the same as Fannie Mae's newly private charter: to expand the secondary market for mortgages and mortgage backed securities by buying mortgages made by savings and loan associations and other depository institutions.  Initially, Freddie Mac was owned by the Federal Home Loan Bank System and governed by the [[Federal Home Loan Bank Board]].

In 1989, the [[Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989]] (&quot;FIRREA&quot;) revised and standardized the regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  It also severed Freddie Mac's ties to the Federal Home Loan Bank System.  The [[Federal Home Loan Bank Board]] (FHLBB) was abolished and replaced by different and separate entities.  An 18-member board of directors for Freddie Mac was formed, and subjected to oversight by the [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD).  Separately, The Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB) was created as an independent agency to take the place of the FHLBB, to oversee the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks (also called district banks).

In 1995, Freddie Mac began receiving affordable housing credit for buying subprime securities, and by 2004, HUD suggested the company was lagging behind and should &quot;do more.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/09/AR2008060902626.html| title=How HUD Mortgage Policy Fed The Crisis|first=Carol D. |last=Leonnig|date= June 10, 2008|publisher=[[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freddie Mac was put under a [[conservatorship]] of the [[U.S. Federal government]] on Sunday, September 7, 2008.

==Business==
{{Recentism|section|date=August 2008}}
Freddie Mac's primary method of making money is by charging a guarantee fee on loans that it has purchased and securitized into [[mortgage-backed security]] (MBS) bonds. Investors, or purchasers of Freddie Mac MBS, are willing to let Freddie Mac keep this fee in exchange for assuming the credit risk, that is, Freddie Mac's guarantee that the principal and interest on the underlying loan will be paid back regardless of whether the borrower actually repays.  Because of Freddie Mac's financial guarantee, these MBS are particularly attractive to investors and, like other Agency MBS, are eligible to be traded in the &quot;to-be-announced,&quot; or &quot;TBA&quot; market.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke, Lins and Picard, ''Mortgage-Backed Securities'', Chapters 2 and 4 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[Alan Greenspan]] and [[Ben Bernanke]] have spoken publicly in favor of greater regulation of the GSEs, because of the size of their holdings and the widespread perception that they are government backed. Freddie Mac is currently regulated by the HUD and the [[Federal Housing Finance Agency|FHFA]]. The [[United States House of Representatives]] passed HR 1427 (''Federal Housing Finance Reform Act of 2007'') to consolidate oversight for Freddie, Fannie, and the [[Federal Home Loan Banks]] into a single regulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conforming loans ===
The GSEs are allowed to buy only [[conforming loan]]s, which limits secondary market demand for non-conforming loans. The relationship between supply and demand typically renders the non-conforming loan harder to sell (fewer competing buyers); thus it would cost the consumer more (typically 1/4 to 1/2 of a percentage point, and sometimes more, depending on credit market conditions). [[Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight|OFHEO]], now merged into the new [[Federal Housing Finance Agency|FHFA]], annually sets the limit of the size of a conforming loan in response to the October to October change in mean home price. Above the conforming loan limit, a mortgage is considered a [[jumbo loan]]. The conforming loan limit is 50 percent higher in such high-cost areas as [[Alaska]], [[Hawaii]], [[Guam]] and the [[US Virgin Islands]]&lt;ref name=FHFA&gt;{{cite web|title=Conforming Loan Limit|url=http://www.fhfa.gov/Default.aspx?Page=185|publisher=FHFA|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; , and is also higher for 2–4 unit properties on a graduating scale. Modifications to these limits were made temporarily to respond to the housing crisis, see [[Jumbo loan]] for recent events.

===Guarantees and subsidies===
In mid July 2008 there was widespread speculation that the US government would move to provide Freddie Mac with additional guarantees of capital, because of widespread instability in the financial markets and public perceptions of looming insolvency. On Sunday July 13 The Secretary of the Treasury announced that the US government would seek legal permission to invest in Freddie Mac, which it later obtained as part of a Congressional housing bill.  In addition, the Federal Reserve offered Freddie access to its emergency borrowing facility, the Discount Window{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}(see also press release of the Fed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/other/20080713a.htm] Press release of the Fed.&lt;/ref&gt;), a resource traditionally reserved for banks.

====No actual guarantees====
The FHLMC states, &quot;securities, including any interest, are not guaranteed by, and are not debts or obligations of, the United States or any agency or instrumentality of the United States other than Freddie Mac.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freddiemac.com/debt/products/faq_fnotes.html Freddie Mac Debt Securities: Freddie Notes FAQ&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The FHLMC and FHLMC securities are not funded or protected by the US Government. FHLMC securities carry no government guarantee of being repaid. This is explicitly stated in the law that authorizes GSEs, on the securities themselves, and in public communications issued by the FHLMC.

====Assumed guarantees====
There is a widespread belief that FHLMC securities are backed by some sort of implied federal guarantee and a majority of investors believe that the government would prevent a disastrous default. Vernon L. Smith, 2002 Nobel Laureate in economics, has called FHLMC and FNMA &quot;implicitly taxpayer-backed agencies.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Vernon L. Smith, &quot;The Clinton Housing Bubble&quot;, Wall Street Journal, December 18, 2007, pA20&lt;/ref&gt; The Economist has referred to &quot;the implicit government guarantee&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The Economist, &quot;Fannie and Freddie ride again&quot;, July 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; of FHLMC and FNMA.

The then-director of the [[Congressional Budget Office]], Dan L. Crippen, testified before Congress in 2001, that the &quot;debt and mortgage-backed securities of GSEs are more valuable to investors than similar private securities because of the perception of a government guarantee.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=2839&amp;type=0 &quot;CBO TESTIMONY Statement of Dan L. Crippen Director, Federal Subsidies for the Housing GSEs before the Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance, and Government Sponsored Enterprises Committee on Financial Services U.S. House of Representatives, May 23, 2001&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Federal subsidies====
The FHLMC receives no direct federal government aid. However, the corporation and the securities it issues are thought to benefit from government subsidies. The Congressional Budget Office writes, &quot;There have been no federal appropriations for cash payments or guarantee subsidies. But in the place of federal funds the government provides considerable unpriced benefits to the enterprises. Government-sponsored enterprises are costly to the government and taxpayers. The benefit is currently worth $6.5 billion annually.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Congressional Budget Office, Assessing the Public Costs and Benefits of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, May 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subprime adjustable rate loans===
Freddie Mac announced on February 27, 2007 that it would buy a [[subprime]] adjustable rate [[mortgages|mortgage]] only if the borrower qualifies for the maximum rate of the loan, rather than merely a low introductory (so-called ''teaser'') rate.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===The mortgage crisis from late 2007===
Following their mission to meet federal Housing and Urban Development [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|(HUD)]] housing goals, GSEs such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks) have striven to improve home ownership of low and middle income families, underserved areas, and generally through special affordable methods such as &quot;the ability to obtain a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a low down payment... and the continuous availability of mortgage credit under a wide range of economic conditions.&quot;  [http://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/gse/reports/2002aharfmacnarrative.pdf (HUD 2002 Annual Housing Activities Report)] Starting in 2003–2004, the market shifted away from regulated GSEs and radically toward Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) issued by unregulated private-label securitization conduits, typically operated by investment banks, beginning a chain of events that led to the [[subprime mortgage crisis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LevitinWachter&quot;&gt;A. J. Levitin, S. M. Wachter “Explaining the Housing Bubble”, online at http://ssrn.com/abstract=1669401)&lt;/ref&gt;

As mortgage originators began to distribute more and more of their loans through private label MBS,  GSEs lost the ability to monitor and control mortgage originators.  Competition between the GSEs and private securitizers for loans further undermined GSEs power and strengthened mortgage originators.  This contributed to a decline in underwriting standards and was a major cause of the financial crisis.&lt;ref name=&quot;SimkovicCompetition&quot;&gt;Michael Simkovic “Competition and Crisis in Mortgage Securitization”, online at http://ssrn.com/abstract=1924831&lt;/ref&gt;

Investment bank securitizers were more willing to securitize risky loans because they generally retained minimal risk.  Whereas the GSEs guaranteed the performance of their MBS, private securitizers generally did not, and might only retain a thin slice of risk.&lt;ref name=&quot;SimkovicCompetition&quot; /&gt; Often, banks would offload this risk to insurance companies or other counterparties through credit default swaps, making their actual risk exposures extremely difficult for investors and creditors to discern.&lt;ref name=&quot;SimkovicSecret&quot;&gt;Michael Simkovic, &quot;Secret Liens and the Financial Crisis of 2008,&quot; http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1323190&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2001-2003, [[financial institution]]s experienced high earnings due to an unprecedented re-financing boom brought about by historically low interest rates. When interest rates eventually rose, financial institutions sought to maintain their elevated earnings levels with a shift toward riskier mortgages and private label MBS distribution. Earnings depended on volume, so maintaining elevated earnings levels necessitated expanding the borrower pool using lower underwriting standards and new products that the GSEs would not (initially) securitize. Thus, the shift away from GSE securitization to private-label securitization (PLS) also corresponded with a shift in mortgage product type, from traditional, amortizing, [[Fixed rate mortgage|fixed-rate mortgages]] (FRMs) to nontraditional, structurally riskier, nonamortizing, adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), and in the start of a sharp deterioration in mortgage underwriting standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;LevitinWachter&quot;/&gt; The growth of PLS, however, forced the GSEs to lower their underwriting standards in an attempt to reclaim lost market share to please their private shareholders. Shareholder pressure pushed the GSEs into competition with PLS for market share, and the GSEs loosened their guarantee business underwriting standards in order to compete. In contrast, the wholly public FHA/Ginnie Mae maintained their underwriting standards and instead ceded market share.&lt;ref name=&quot;LevitinWachter&quot;/&gt;

The growth of private-label securitization and lack of regulation in this part of the market resulted in the oversupply of underpriced housing finance&lt;ref name=&quot;LevitinWachter&quot;/&gt; that led, in 2006, to an increasing number of borrowers, often with poor credit, who were unable to pay their mortgages—particularly with adjustable rate mortgages [[Adjustable-rate mortgage|(ARM)]]—caused a precipitous increase in home foreclosures. As a result, home prices declined as increasing foreclosures added to the already large inventory of homes and stricter lending standards made it more and more difficult for borrowers to get mortgages. This depreciation in home prices led to growing losses for the GSEs, which back the majority of US mortgages. In July 2008, the government attempted to ease market fears by reiterating their view that &quot;Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play a central role in the US housing finance system&quot;. The [[US Treasury Department]] and the [[Federal Reserve]] took steps to bolster confidence in the corporations, including granting both corporations access to Federal Reserve low-interest loans (at similar rates as commercial banks) and removing the prohibition on the Treasury Department to purchase the GSEs' stock. Despite these efforts, by August 2008, shares of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had tumbled more than 90% from their one-year prior levels.

On Oct 21, 2010, FHFA estimates revealed that the bailout of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae will likely cost taxpayers $224–360 billion in total, with over $150 billion already provided.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/housing/2010-10-21-fannie-mae-freddie-mac-bailout_N.htm | work=USA Today | first=Paul | last=Davidson | title=Fannie, Freddie bailout to cost taxpayers $154 billion | date=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigations===
In 2003, Freddie Mac revealed that it had understated earnings by almost $5 billion, one of the largest corporate restatements in U.S. history. As a result, in November, it was fined $125 million—an amount called &quot;peanuts&quot; by [[Forbes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/2003/12/11/cx_aw_1211freddie.html | work=Forbes | title=Shaking Steady Freddie | date=2003-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18, 2006, Freddie Mac was fined $3.8 million, by far the largest amount ever assessed by the Federal Election Commission, as a result of illegal campaign contributions. Freddie Mac was accused of illegally using corporate resources between 2000 and 2003 for 85 fundraisers that collected about $1.7 million for federal candidates. Much of the illegal fund raising benefited members of the [[House Financial Services Committee]], a panel whose decisions can affect Freddie Mac. Notably, Freddie Mac held more than 40 fundraisers for House Financial Services Chairman [[Michael Oxley]], R-Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12373488/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government subsidies and bailout ===
Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac often benefited from an implied guarantee of fitness equivalent to truly federally backed financial groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Goodman, Wes and Shenn, Jody|title=Fannie Mae Rescue Hindered as Asians Seek Guarantee (Update2)|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&amp;sid=azObP8_4deuI|date=February 20, 2009|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac owned or guaranteed about half of the U.S.'s $12 trillion mortgage market.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytduhigg&quot;&gt;Duhigg, Charles, [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/business/11ripple.html?ex=1373515200&amp;en=8ad220403fcfdf6e&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink &quot;Loan-Agency Woes Swell From a Trickle to a Torrent&quot;], The New York Times, Friday, July 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This made both corporations highly susceptible to the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] of that year. Ultimately, in July 2008, the speculation was made reality, when the US government took action to prevent the collapse of both corporations. The [[US Treasury Department]] and the [[Federal Reserve]] took several steps to bolster confidence in the corporations, including extending credit limits, granting both corporations access to Federal Reserve low-interest loans (at similar rates as commercial banks), and potentially allowing the Treasury Department to own stock.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnnfnma&quot;&gt;Luhby, Tami, [http://money.cnn.com/2008/07/13/news/economy/fannie_freddie_sunday/index.htm?postversion=2008071405], CNN Money, Monday, July 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  This event also renewed calls for stronger regulation of GSEs by the government.

President Bush recommended a significant regulatory overhaul of the housing finance industry in 2003, but many Democrats opposed his plan, fearing that tighter regulation could greatly reduce financing for low-income housing, both low- and high-risk.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytlabaton&quot;&gt;

S. 190 was reported out of the Senate Banking Committee on July 28, 2005, but never voted on by the full Senate.

On May 23, 2006, the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac regulator, the [[Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight]], issued the results of a 27 month long investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Report of the Special Examination of Fannie Mae May 2006 | date= May 2006 | publisher= Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight | url=http://www.ofheo.gov/media/pdf/FNMSPECIALEXAM.PDF |format=PDF| work = | pages =| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 25, 2006, Senator McCain joined as a co-sponsor to the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005 (first put forward by Sen.

The top 10 recipients of campaign contributions from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae during the 1989 to 2008 time period include 5 Republicans and 5 Democrats. Top recipients of PAC money from these organizations include Roy Blunt (R-MO) $78,500 (total including individuals' contributions $96,950), Robert Bennett (R-UT) $71,499 (total $107,999), Spencer Bachus (R-AL) $70,500 (total $103,300), and Kit Bond (R-MO) $95,400 (total $64,000).

=== Conservatorship ===
{{main | Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac}}
{{wikinews|Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae placed into US government conservatorship}}

On September 7, 2008, [[Federal Housing Finance Agency]] (FHFA) Director James B. Lockhart III announced pursuant to the financial analysis, assessments and statutory authority of the FHFA, he had placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under the conservatorship of the FHFA. FHFA has stated that there are no plans to liquidate the company.&lt;ref name=&quot;ofheo.gov&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name='FHFA-Conservatorship-2008-09-07'/&gt;

The announcement followed reports two days earlier that the Federal government was planning to take over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and had met with their CEOs on short notice.&lt;ref name='Washington Post-Hilzenrath &amp; Goldfarb-2008-09-05'&gt;{{cite news | first= David S. | last= Hilzenrath | coauthors= Zachary A.

Under the reported plan, the federal government, via the FHFA, would place the two firms into conservatorship and for each entity, dismiss the chief executive officer, the present board of directors, elect a new board of directors, and cause to be issued new common stock to the federal government. The value of the common stock to pre-conservatorship holders would be greatly diminished, in the effort to maintain the value of company debt and of mortgage-backed securities.&lt;ref name='Washington Post-Goldfarb, Cho &amp; Appelbaum-2008-09-07'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Washington Post-Hilzenrath &amp; Goldfarb-2008-09-05'/&gt;&lt;ref name='NYTimes-Labaton &amp; Sorkin-2008-09-05'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Washington Post-Hilzenrath, Irwin, Goldfarb-2008-09-06'/&gt;

The authority of the U.S. Treasury to advance funds for the purpose of stabilizing Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac is limited only by the amount of debt that the entire federal government is permitted by law to commit to. The July 30, 2008, law enabling expanded regulatory authority over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac increased the national debt ceiling by US$800 billion, to  a total of US$ 10.7 trillion in anticipation of the potential need for the Treasury to have the flexibility to support the federal home loan banks.&lt;ref name='NYTimes-Herszenhorn-2008-07-27'&gt;{{cite news | first= David | last= Herszenhorn | coauthors= | title= Congress Sends Housing Relief Bill to President | date= 2008-07-27 | publisher= | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/27/washington/27housing.html

'''''Rock Island''''' is the 17th studio [[album]] by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Rock music|rock]] group [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], released in 1989.

The album continued the hard rock direction the band took on the previous effort, ''[[Crest of a Knave]]'' (1987). The line-up now included [[Ian Anderson (singer and musician)|Ian Anderson]], [[Martin Barre]], [[Dave Pegg]], and new drummer [[Doane Perry]].

The staging on the 1989 tour supporting ''Rock Island'' featured projected [[Shadow play|silhouettes]] of lithe dancers during the song &quot;Kissing Willie&quot;, ending with an image that bordered on [[pornographic]]. The song &quot;Big Riff and Mando&quot; reflects life on the road for the relentlessly touring musicians, giving a wry account of the theft of Barre's prized [[mandolin]] by a stage-struck fan.

*The bonus tracks were recorded live in [[Zurich, Switzerland]] on 13 October 1989. They had previously been released on the UK CD single of &quot;Another Christmas Song&quot;.

==Personnel==
* [[Ian Anderson (singer and musician)|Ian Anderson]] – vocals, flute, keyboards, Synclavier, mandolin, acoustic guitar, drums on tracks 2 &amp; 7
* [[Martin Barre]] – guitars
* [[Dave Pegg|David Pegg]] – bass guitar, acoustic bass, mandolin
* [[Doane Perry]] – drums
Also featuring:
* [[Martin Allcock]] – keyboards on tracks 1 &amp; 10
* [[Peter-John Vettese|Peter Vettese]] – additional keyboards on tracks 3, 4, 5 &amp; 6

==Introduction by Ian Anderson==
In 2006, for the remastered CD, Anderson wrote an introduction to each song of the original album:

*'''Kissing Willie''' is a not-too-subtle approach to love and life behind grey factory walls. Actually bassist Dave Pegg inspired this one with a tale, imagined or real, who knows, of an awkward teenage mutual fumble behind the gasworks somewhere on the fringes of his home town of Birmingham in the Midlands of the UK. A rather over-the-top video went with this one and is not one of my proudest moments. Director [[Storm Thorgerson]] wanted a [[Benny Hill]] kind of thing and so I Bennied, dutifully. Regretfully.
*'''The Rattlesnake Trail''' is a medium tempo rocker of the [[ZZ Top]] persuasion. Guitar-based and never performed on stage. Just an excuse for a funky rocking good time.
*'''Ears of Tin''' plays on the social disintegration of the West Highlands of Scotland. The move to the big city. The regrets. The longing.
*'''Undressed to Kill''' is a strip club through-the-keyhole, life of a working girl song. A certain sadness and grim determination lurks in the young female personality behind the lap-dance frivolity of the setting.
*'''Rock Island''' is a rather good song, I think. Loneliness and detachment. Fear of the far-off unknown. The rock island as metaphor for the isolated but familiar bubble into which we all sometimes retreat. The blue baby blanket security. Back to the womb. For beer, curry and a game of skittles.
*'''Heavy Water''' reflects on the environmental damage from [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] but was inspired also by the horrors of the acid rain reality of 20th century industrial pollution. Memories of a hot and sticky New York City summer in the early seventies when the rainspots on my sleeve were an ominous black.
*'''Another Christmas Song''' is probably my favourite piece from the album, being generally uplifting in this sea of misery! It was actually written as a sequel to the original &quot;Christmas Song&quot;, B-side on an early Tull single in 1968. It was also re-recorded for ''[[the Jethro Tull Christmas Album]]'' in 2003. A song of family togetherness, nostalgia and benevolence. The antithesis of the original, in some ways.
*'''The Whaler's Dues''' tackles the difficult subject of the moral question of whale-hunting, seen from the perspective of a seaman on board on a whaling ship. Set in the contemporary world, it in no way tries to condone or excuse the on-going practice but puts our hero (or villain) up in the dock for sentence and martyrdom. For all my Japanese and Icelandic friends to ponder on...
*'''Big Riff and Mando''' is based on the true event of the theft of Martin Barre's mandolin from backstage after a show somewhere in the USA a few months before. Martin was understandably distraught and I made plea via a helpful local Classic Rock radio station to the perpetrator. To our amazement, the mandoline was returned undamaged and lived to fight another day. Why did the thief take it? To brag out? To have as a souvenir? Or to keep for a few years until e-Bay was invented? Marty is Martin, obviously. Big Riff is the imagined thief and a little story is invented here to portray the character and his motives.
*'''Strange Avenues''' is a little sequel to the ''[[Aqualung (Jethro Tull album)|Aqualung]]'' setting of 1971. Sometimes it is so nice to revisit an earlier song and re-create, for a moment, the subject in another piece of invaded personal space. Nice musical arrangement and dramatic stuff. Must play it live again some day.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Dorset Geology.png|thumb|350px|Geological map of Dorset]]
'''Dorset''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|d|ɔr|s|ɨ|t}} (or [[Archaism|archaically]], '''Dorsetshire''') is a [[Counties of England|county]] in [[South West England]] on the [[English Channel]] coast. Covering an area of {{convert|2653|km2|sqmi|0}}; it borders [[Devon]] to the west, [[Somerset]] to the north-west, [[Wiltshire]] to the north-east, and [[Hampshire]] to the east. The great variation in its landscape owes much to the underlying geology which includes an almost unbroken sequence of rocks from 200 Ma to 40 Ma and superficial deposits from 2 Ma to the present.&lt;ref name=CHA5-6&gt;Chaffey (pp.5-6)&lt;/ref&gt; In general the oldest rocks ([[Early Jurassic]]) appear in the far west of the county, with the most recent ([[Eocene]]) in the far east. Jurassic rocks also underlie the Blackmore Vale and comprise much of the coastal cliff in the west and south of the county; and although younger Cretaceous rocks crown some of the highpoints in the west, they are mainly to be found in the centre and east of the county.&lt;ref name=CHA6&gt;Chaffey (p.6)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorset's coastline is one of the most visited and studied coastlines in the world because it shows, along the course of {{convert|95|mi|km|0}} (including some of east [[Devon]]), rocks from the beginning of [[Triassic]], through the [[Jurassic]] and up to the end of the [[Cretaceous]], documenting the entire [[Mesozoic]] era with well-preserved [[fossil]]s.&lt;ref&gt;House (1993) pp.1-4&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout Dorset there are a number of [[limestone]] ridges.&lt;ref&gt;Chaffey pp.5-7&lt;/ref&gt; The largest and most notable is the band of [[Cretaceous]] [[chalk]] that runs from the south-west to the north-east of the county and forms part of the [[Chalk Group]] that underlies much of the south of England, including [[Salisbury Plain]], the [[Isle of Wight]] and the [[South Downs]]. Between the bands of limestone and chalk are wide [[clay]] [[River valley|vale]]s with [[flood plain]]s.

South-east Dorset, around [[Poole]], [[Bournemouth]] and the [[New Forest]], lies on younger and less resistant beds: Eocene clays (mainly [[London Clay]]), [[sand]]s and [[gravel]]s. These rocks produce thin soils that historically have supported a [[heathland]] habitat. The chalk and limestone hills of the [[Isle of Purbeck|Purbeck]]s lie atop Britain's largest onshore [[oil field]]. The field, operated from [[Wytch Farm]], produces a high-quality oil and has the world's oldest continuously pumping well at [[Kimmeridge]], which has been in use since the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Cullingford (p.122)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/STAGING/global_assets/downloads/U/uk_asset_wytch_farm.pdf|title=Wytch Farm|work=Asset Portfolio|publisher=BP|accessdate=8 March 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65ctcW4NE|archivedate=21 February 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source of this oil is the organic-rich shales found in the lower lias. Landslides along the coast have been known to ignite these shales causing cliff fires, the most recent of which occurred in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Ensom (1998) pp.22-23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= NatEng&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/geodiversity/englands/counties/area_ID9.aspx|title=Geodiversity: Dorset|page=|work= |publisher= Natural England|accessdate=24 January 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/66ihIvWI0|archivedate=6 April 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Permian and Triassic==

===380&amp;ndash;204 Ma (late Devonian &amp;ndash; late Triassic)===
380 million years ago ([[Year#Symbols y and yr|Ma]]) the landmass that was later to form Southern Britain was some 19 degrees south of the equator and lay on the northern shore of an ocean basin that separated the continents of [[Laurasia]] and [[Gondwanaland]]. When these continents collided to form the single super-continent of [[Pangaea]], the sediments on the ocean floor were pushed up and over while the molten rock below the surface was forced out.&lt;ref&gt;Ensom (p.13)&lt;/ref&gt; Today, these [[igneous intrusion]]s and the red [[sandstones]], visible in the neighbouring county of Devon, slope away from west to east and are deeply buried beneath younger deposits in Dorset.&lt;ref&gt;Ensom (p.14)&lt;/ref&gt; Around 204 Ma Dorset, now 30 degrees north, was under water and the first [[ammonite]]s (''Psiloceras planorbis'') appear among the shales and limestones that make up the lower Lias.&lt;ref&gt;Ensom (p.19)&lt;/ref&gt;

===204&amp;ndash;191 Ma (late Triassic &amp;ndash; early Jurassic)===
[[File:Blue lias cliffs at Lyme Regis.jpg|thumb|The blue lias cliffs at Lyme Regis]]

Formed somewhere between 191 Ma and 204 Ma, in what was then a shallow marine environment, the lower [[Lias Group|Lias]] is composed of Blue Lias, Black Ven Marls and Green Ammonite Beds. Mostly covered by lush vegetation, it forms the floor of [[Marshwood Vale]] in the west of Dorset and can be seen in stream beds, where the land has been excavated, and along the coast to the west of [[Seatown]]. The sides of the vale are mainly made from the clays and sands of the upper and lower Lias while younger strata from the [[Cretaceous Period]] (145-66 Ma), crown the higher points.&lt;ref&gt;Ensom (p.21)&lt;/ref&gt; The Blue Lias is the lowest of the Liassic stratum and where it is visible on the coast near Lyme Regis is layered with hard limestone and oil-rich shale.&lt;ref&gt;Ensom (p.22)&lt;/ref&gt; The iron pyrites in the clay can heat up when exposed to the air and occasionally ignite the shales.&lt;ref name=E23&gt;Ensom (p.23)&lt;/ref&gt;

Around [[Lyme Regis|Lyme]], during the 18th and 19th centuries, the collecting and sale of fossils became a popular occupation. Landslides and the excavation of the clays, used in cement production, exposed not only an abundance of ammonites of varying size, but much larger specimens such as Ichthyosaurs and Plesiosaurs.&lt;ref name=E23&gt;Ensom (p.23)&lt;/ref&gt; Although these rocks were formed underwater, the discovery of fossilised wood, land-dwelling animals and a Pterosaur suggest that dry land was close by.&lt;ref&gt;Ensom (p.24)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jurassic==

===191&amp;ndash;190 Ma (early Jurassic)===
Laid down between 191 Ma and 190 Ma years ago in a shallower marine environment that was subjected to much more turbulent weather conditions, the sediments of the middle Lias are not as muddy as those in the lower Lias, and are much nearer to silt and sand.&lt;ref name=E25&gt;Ensom (p.25)&lt;/ref&gt; These sands are thought to have come from the islands that now form part of Cornwall and South Wales.&lt;ref name=E25/&gt; Again, inland exposure is poor, although the middle Lias is visible along the spring line of the hills that surround the Marshwood Vale. The cliffs either side of [[Eype]] and the coastal stretch between [[Thorncombe]] and Watton Cliff provide the best view.&lt;ref name=E25/&gt; The base of the middle Lias is composed of three thick layers of calcareous sandstone beds separated by marls. These resistant bands form massive buttresses along the sea-cliffs and, where eroded, boulder aprons on the foreshore.

Above these three layers is the Eype clay, which was probably deposited in deeper, calmer waters.&lt;ref&gt;Ensom (p.26)&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonites found in this layer have apparently been attacked by larger crustaceans. The fossilised remains of large numbers of brittle stars, found towards the end of this deposition, indicate that they were rapidly covered. Theories put forward suggest a great storm or tidal wave was the cause and indeed many of the remains appear to have been swept along the sediment, some losing limbs on the way. This particular section of the lias is appropriately known as the &quot;starfish bed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ensom (P.26-27)&lt;/ref&gt; The succeeding layers of Downcliffe and Thorncombe sands also appear to have been deposited in a periodically stormy environment where silts and sands dominate. Pebbles and cobbles are found here, encrusted with fossilised animals, which suggests that some of the sediments were already [[Lithification#Lithification|lithified]]; there is also some evidence of localised fault activity.&lt;ref&gt;Ensom (p.28)&lt;/ref&gt; The last layer in the middle Lias is the Marlstone Rock Bed.

===190&amp;ndash;180 Ma (early Jurassic)===
[[File:East Cliffs, West Bay, Dorset - geograph.org.uk - 758051.jpg|thumb|The distinctive yellow cliffs near West Bay, formed of Bridport sand]]

The lowest part of the upper lias, formed around 190 Ma, is known as the junction bed and despite representing 3,000,000 years, is only 0.6 to 1.5 metres thick, where it can be seen at [[Eype Mouth]].&lt;ref name=E29&gt;Ensom (p.29)&lt;/ref&gt; In Yorkshire the equivalent strata is around 100 metres thick, suggesting that Dorset remained underwater much longer and was robbed of supplies of sand and clay. This bed is composed of fine grain limestones from white to pale pink in colour.&lt;ref name=E29&gt;Ensom (P.29)&lt;/ref&gt; The clearest evidence of fault activity exists in a section of cliff between West Bay and Eype Mouth, where the junction bed thickens in a section of steps, and fractures in the rock contain sediment from the ocean bed which, most likely, was sucked in as the cracks opened.&lt;ref name=E29/&gt;

The remaining part of the upper Lias is the bright yellow Bridport sandstone that gives the cliffs between West Bay and Burton Bradstock their distinctive colour.&lt;ref name=E31&gt;Ensom (p.31)&lt;/ref&gt; The sands form a band that runs inland to [[Yeovil]]. In the east of the county, these sands are some 900 metres below the surface and form the Wytch Farm oilfield’s middle reservoir.&lt;ref name=E31/&gt;

===180&amp;ndash;170 Ma (early &amp;ndash; middle Jurassic)===
The succeeding [[Inferior Oolite]] was deposited in a shallow, tropical marine environment, 35 degrees north of the equator. It is only 2 metres thick in the south but increases to 20 metres in the north, near Sherborne.&lt;ref name=E32&gt;Ensom (p.32)&lt;/ref&gt; It contains many fossils, including bryozoans, brachiopods, ammonites, belemnites, gastropods, bivalves and echinoids, and like the previous middle and upper Lias shows signs of fault-controlled deposition.&lt;ref name=E32/&gt; It appears in some places that the sea floor was breached and sediments and fossils were trapped like those in the junction bed between West Bay and Eype. Most of Dorset was starved of sediment and condensed limestones collected.&lt;ref name=E32/&gt; These limestone beds are often iron rich, lending them a rusty colour. One particular bed, exposed at Burton Cliff, contains large numbers of orange, discus-shaped concretions, which on closer inspection reveal themselves to be pieces of shell from a species of mussel, coated with a thin layer of iron-rich sediment.&lt;ref name=E33&gt;Ensom (p.33)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the upper section of the Inferior Oolite there are two beds packed with numerous types of sponge, which can be seen around Shipton Gorge and Burton Bradstock.&lt;ref name=E34&gt;Ensom (p.34)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being formed in a marine environment, the oolite, like the lower Lias, contains some fossilised remains of land-dwelling creatures, including two species of ''[[Megalosaurus]]'' that were found near Sherborne.&lt;ref name=E34/&gt;

===170&amp;ndash;160 Ma (middle &amp;ndash; late Jurassic)===
Fullers Earth clays were deposited across much of southern Dorset when the continental shelf subsided, forcing the region deeper underwater. The lower clays are visible at [[Burton Bradstock]] and contain large numbers of ''Bositra buchi''. It has been suggested that these bivalves were able to swim freely and thus able to avoid the soupy mud on the sea floor.&lt;ref name=E35/36&gt;Ensom (pp.35-36)&lt;/ref&gt; A limestone known as Fullers Earth Rock is found in the north-west of the county, between the clays south and east of Sherborne. It is rich in ammonites and bivalves.&lt;ref name=E36&gt;Ensom (p.36)&lt;/ref&gt; Previously referred to as the Upper Fullers Earth Clay, the succeeding Frome Clay can be seen to the west of West Bay where it forms the major part of the West Cliff. It contains many [[Brachiopods]], particularly in the Weymouth Anticline where the oyster beds are 5 metres thick.&lt;ref name=E36/&gt; At the junction between the Frome Clay and the overlying Forest Marble is the Boueti Bed, so called because of the large numbers of the brachiopod, ''Goniorhynchia boueti'' found there. It is best viewed on the Herbury peninsula south of [[Langton Herring]].&lt;ref name=E36/&gt; The limestone known as Forest Marble is not a true metamorphic marble but it takes a high polish, and has been used as a building material and marble substitute for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Ensom (pp.37-38)&lt;/ref&gt; Outcrops of Forest Marble are concentrated around the Weymouth Anticline, the coastal escarpment between Burton Bradstock and [[Abbotsbury]], and inland as far as [[Bothenhampton]], where they disappear below younger Cretaceous deposits. Surfacing once more at [[Rampisham]], they turn east and then north into [[Somerset]].&lt;ref name=E38&gt;Ensom (p.38)&lt;/ref&gt; The limestone does not form one continuous bed as previously thought, but rather forms pockets in a formation which is predominately clay. It is likely that severe tropical storms swept up large quantities of shells and other invertebrates and deposited them in this way.&lt;ref name=E38/&gt; The formation of the Forest Marble suggests a shallowing of the sea and the remains of pieces of tree, and bits of land-dwelling animals, are found among the turtles, frogs and salamanders within.&lt;ref name=E38/&gt;

===160&amp;ndash;145 Ma (late Jurassic)===
Between 160 Ma and 145 Ma, the future Dorset, at 36 degrees north, still had a tropical climate and the limestones, clays, silts and sands from this period were laid down in a marine environment that ranged from deep water to tidal shallows.&lt;ref name=E39&gt;Ensom (p.39)&lt;/ref&gt; Above the Forest Marble lies the [[Cornbrash]] sequence which is dominated by rubbly limestone. Unsuitable for building stone, these limestones have been used lime production and road construction. In the north of the county an already lithified Cornbrash floor was being eroded, and the resulting pebbles gathered serpulid worms, bryozoans and bivalves as they rolled around beneath the shallow sea.&lt;ref name=E39/&gt; The shallow water in which these limestones were deposited was followed by marginally deeper water in which the [[Kellaways Formation|Kellaway Beds]] were laid down. The Kellaway Beds are only visible in the banks of streams and rivers, and the brick pits at [[Chickerell]] and Rampisham where the succeeding [[Oxford Clay Formation|Oxford Clays]] were quarried.&lt;ref&gt;Ensom (pp.39-40)&lt;/ref&gt; The Oxford Clays were deposited in much deeper water and cover the valley floors between Weymouth and the Blackmore Vale.They can also be seen in the cliffs at Tidmoor Point, [[Jordan Hill, Dorset|Jordan Hill]] and the previously mentioned brick pits at Chickerell.&lt;ref name=E40&gt;Ensom (p.40)&lt;/ref&gt; Poor exposure, coupled with a decline in the brick industry has made detailed mapping of the clays difficult which now relies heavily on trenches dug for services. These excavations have unearthed some impressive examples of [[Septarian Nodule]]s.&lt;ref name=E40/&gt;

The exposure of Nothe Grit, to the south of Weymouth, suggests a return to shallower water conditions and a more turbulent environment. In the following 4.5 million years a cycle of lagoonal, tidal and deep water environments caused by a world-wide fluctuations in sea levels, deposited beds of sand, clay and limestone across the entire county.&lt;ref&gt;Ensom (pp.40-41)&lt;/ref&gt; The Corallian strata can be seen on the Weymouth anticline, between Abbotsbury and [[Osmington]]. It then disappears to emerge as a low escarpment between [[Mappowder]] and [[Cucklington]] on the [[Somerset]] border. Near the top of this formation is the Ringstead Waxy Clay in which large delta shaped oysters are found and at the top of the Corallian is the Ringstead Coral Bed.&lt;ref name=E42&gt;Ensom (p.42)&lt;/ref&gt;

Benecliff grit, a soft sandstone containing large doggers, is well exposed at the headland, Bran Point. Once a reservoir, oil sometimes seeps from the cliff here, and an oily residue is present in the sands nearby.&lt;ref name=E42/&gt;

===145&amp;ndash;140 Ma (Late Jurassic)===
[[File:Beach and cliffs, Egmont Bight - geograph.org.uk - 900296.jpg|thumb|Kimmeridge Clay in the cliffs at Egmont Bight]]
The varied rock types of the Corallian are superseded by the Kimmeridge clay, a bed of dark clays and shales up to 500 metres thick. These deposits occurred in a deep marine environment, 38 degrees north, 140 Ma to 145 Ma.&lt;ref name=E43&gt;Ensom (p.43)&lt;/ref&gt; Deposited in an oxygen deficient environment, the Kimmeridge beds make up the major part of the Purbeck Monocline and the periphery of the Weymouth Anticline. They form a low lying band running north to south through the [[Blackmore Vale]], and underpin the strip of land between the isle of Portland and the mainland.&lt;ref name=E43/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaffey (p.12)&lt;/ref&gt; The unusual iron rich sediment near Abbotsbury was, in a departure from the norm, deposited in shallow iron rich water and the pale bands throughout the formation were caused by [[Coccolith]]s following periodic blooms of algae.

Many of the fossilised remains are squashed flat, indicating that the Kimmeridge beds were heavily compacted, perhaps to an eighth of their original thickness. This was not sufficient to produce oil reservoirs like those beneath the [[North Sea]], yet the oil rich shales have, in the past, been economically important as a local fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Ensom (pp.45-46)&lt;/ref&gt;

===140-137 Ma (Late Jurassic)===

It is unclear whether the formations created between the Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous, were deposited across the whole of Dorset like the preceding beds, and subsequently eroded, or only formed in the areas in which they are now found.&lt;ref name=E47&gt;Ensom (p.47)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Portland sands were created in a deep marine environment whereas the [[Portland stone]] was a near shore deposit.&lt;ref name=E47/&gt; The lower Portland Sand formation, usually greyish blue in colour, is a [[Dolomitic]] sand limestone best viewed on the West Weares, Gad Cliff and Hounstout. The overlying Portland stone is a distinctive white Oolite containing thick shelled fossils and marine algae.&lt;ref name=E48&gt;Ensom (p.48)&lt;/ref&gt; The marine algae which formed large reefs, is responsible for the occasional stacked and arched bands in the formation and is best viewed in the Roach, an extremely fossiliferous limestone confined to the north of [[Isle of Portland|Portland]].&lt;ref&gt;Ensom (pp.48-49)&lt;/ref&gt;

To the north of the Oolite is a fine grained limestone, which was deposited in calm, shallow water. It contains flint-like rocks known as [[Chert]] and if it wasn't for the presence of very large ammonites, might be mistaken for an early chalk.&lt;ref&gt;Ensom (p.50)&lt;/ref&gt; Previously thought to be around the middle of the Purbeck Strata, modern research suggests that the end of the Portland limestone marks the boundary between the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.&lt;ref name=E51&gt;Ensom (p.51)&lt;/ref&gt;

===137&amp;ndash;130 Ma (Late Jurassic &amp;ndash; early Cretaceous)===
[[File:Fossil Forest, West Lulworth, Dorset - geograph.org.uk - 603310.jpg|thumb|Part of the fossil forest, West Lulworth]]
The Purbeck limestone group is a succession of limestones, shales and clays named after the [[Isle of Purbeck]], laid down mainly in very shallow lagoons and freshwater lakes, with only occasional marine influence at the lower levels where [[salt]], [[gypsum]] and other [[evaporite]]s are found.&lt;ref name=E51&gt;Ensom (p.51)&lt;/ref&gt; The muddled sediments around Lulworth are thought to be caused by a thick layer of these evaporites dissolving. There is also evidence of uplift and erosion of earlier formations. The climate around this time had changed from a tropical to a sub-tropical one, with pronounced wet and dry seasons as indicated by the growth rings in the fosslised trees also found in the lower levels of the Purbeck strata.&lt;ref&gt;Ensom (pp.51-52)&lt;/ref&gt; These trees grew around the low coastal areas and were, from time to time, subjected to drowning from the sea. The fallen trees and their stumps became covered by [[stromatolites]] which trapped sediments. The limestones at this level, which vary greatly in colour, are composed of densely packed shells of the freshwater snail ''[[Viviparus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Arkell, W. J. (1947), ''Geology of the country round Weymouth, Swanage, Corfe Castle and Lulworth''. London: HMSO for British Geological Survey.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clements, R. G. (1993), &quot;Type-section of the Purbeck Limestone Group, Durlston Bay, Swanage, Dorset&quot;, ''Proceedings of the Dorset Natural History and Archaeological Society'', '''114''', 181–206.&lt;/ref&gt; Their ability to take a very high polish has led them to become known as [[Purbeck Marble]]. Like the older Forest Marble it is a sedimentary marble rather than a true metamorphic one.&lt;ref&gt;Ensom (p.52)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Purbeck Limestone Group has yielded a diverse selection of fossilised remains, including rare reptiles, amphibians and mammals, for which the formation has become internationally important.&lt;ref&gt;Ensom (pp.52 &amp; 56)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cretaceous==

===130&amp;ndash;113 Ma (early Cretaceous)===
The [[Wealden Supergroup|Wealden Beds]] are confined to the south and increase in thickness from 107 metres to 716 metres, between [[Upwey, Dorset|Upwey]] and [[Swanage]].&lt;ref name=E57/&gt; By 130 million years ago, the waters covering Dorset's landmass had subsided leaving the area almost completely terrestrial save for the large rivers that dominated it.&lt;ref name=E57&gt;Ensom (p.57)&lt;/ref&gt; These rivers drained the upland areas to the north and west, and were responsible for depositing much of the succeeding sediment across southern Dorset.&lt;ref name=E57/&gt; Comprising clays, silts, sands and grits, they cover the floors of the valleys between Lulworth and Swanage. The sands and grits are also exposed in the cliffs there, and form ridges along the valleys.&lt;ref name=E57/&gt; Traces of granite from Cornubia, the landmass that later became Cornwall, were also washed down.&lt;ref name=E59&gt;Ensom (p.59)&lt;/ref&gt; The Wealden Beds contain a great deal of plant matter and [[charcoal]] indicating periodic fires in the region. At [[Mupe Bay]], some of the sands have been bound together by oil and formed into sandstone boulders, suggesting that oil production had already begun when these sands were deposited.&lt;ref name=E59/&gt;

===113&amp;ndash;97 Ma (early &amp;ndash; late Cretaceous)===
The marginal marine incursions that occurred in the previous period increased in severity until Dorset was completely underwater. The geology from this period indicates a gradual flooding of the county from the south-east to the north-west.&lt;ref name=E60&gt;Ensom (p.60)&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest deposit, the [[Lower Greensand Group|Lower Greensand]], covers the preceding Wealden Beds in the south, and the Oxford and Kimmeridge clays in the north.&lt;ref name=E60/&gt; It is so called because of its green colour which is caused by the presence of the mineral [[Glauconite]].&lt;ref name=E62&gt;Ensom (p.62)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the west, overlying the eroded Lias, is a thin layer of [[Gault clay]] which decreases in depth from 27 metres to 7 metres the further west it stretches, and can be located by the spring lines around the chalk ridges and escarpments.&lt;ref&gt;Ensom (pp.60&amp;61)&lt;/ref&gt; The water that sits between these two beds is responsible for the many landslips which have occurred throughout the county's history.&lt;ref name=E62/&gt; Around [[Compton Valence]], it lies on the Fuller's Earth whereas between [[Ringstead, Dorset|Ringstead]] and [[White Nothe]], it covers the Kimmeridge clay and the Portland and Purbeck stratas.&lt;ref&gt;Ensom (pp.60-61)&lt;/ref&gt; Because geologists are certain all the formations from the Lias to the Kimmeridge clay were deposited over the whole of the county, the Gault clay reveals the scale of uplift and erosion which must have taken place before Dorset was flooded.&lt;ref name=E61&gt;Ensom (p.61)&lt;/ref&gt; The overlying Gault is revealed in the spring lines around the chalk ridges and escarpments.&lt;ref name=E61/&gt; This water is also responsible for the many landslips throughout Dorset's history from the prehistoric to modern times.&lt;ref name=E62&gt;Ensom (p.62)&lt;/ref&gt;

Above the Gault is the [[Upper Greensand]], which varies from the golden sands that crown the West Dorset heights, such as [[Pilsdon Pen]] and [[Golden Cap]], to the rubbly sandstones found in the centre of the county.&lt;ref name=E62/&gt; The fossiliferous, green sandstone found around [[Shaftesbury]] contains many ammonites which, when compared to other deposits, indicate condensed deposition during different periods at different locations and detailed analysis reveals that basement structures were still active at this time.&lt;ref name=E62/&gt;

===97&amp;ndash;65 Ma (late Cretaceous &amp;ndash; Paleocene)===
The sea levels remained more or less unchanged until the end of the Cretaceous period and despite Dorset having moved even further north to 40 degrees, the climate had reverted to a tropical one. During this period, the sea deposited an enormous amount of chalk across the county, perhaps as much as 300 metres more than there is currently.&lt;ref name=E63&gt;Ensom (p.63)&lt;/ref&gt; The first chalk deposits contained sands and grits thought to have originated in Cornubia. This gritty chalk was deposited across central Dorset and can clearly be seen in the sides of [[Eggardon Hill]]. As the water deepened, [[plankton]], coccoliths and [[foraminifera]] became the main source for the calcereous soup which would later form the Dorset chalk.&lt;ref name=E63/&gt; The chalk forms a narrow strip inland between [[Studland]] and [[Worbarrow Bay]] when it reaches the coast once more. A much wider strip continues westward along the coast until it meets the wide swathe of chalk that cuts north-west across the county and forms the south-east point of the [[Hampshire Basin]].&lt;ref name=E64&gt;Ensom (p.64)&lt;/ref&gt; Generally the Dorset chalk is too soft to be used as a building stone except along the [[Wessex Ridgeway|Ridgeway]] where faulting and folding produced a particularly hard variety popularly used by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] in their [[mosaic]]s. The chalk often contains larger fossils including ammonites, belemnites and brachiopods. Flint occurs throughout in both nodule and tabular layers.&lt;ref name=E64/&gt;

The [[iridium]] rich layer of sediment, found around the world at the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|K-T]] boundary, is missing in Dorset. This may be due to the uplift and erosion that removed the upper layers of the chalk.&lt;ref name=E66&gt;Ensom (p.66)&lt;/ref&gt; The sediments resting on the Dorset chalk are, for the same reason, distinctly different from those in other parts of the world, and the remains of the plants and animals within, much more recent.&lt;ref name=E68&gt;Ensom (p.68)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paleogene and Neogene==

===65&amp;ndash;40 Ma (Paleocene &amp;ndash; Eocene)===
[[File:Geograph-2158028-by-Nigel-Mykura.jpg|thumb|The edge of Culpepper's Dish, a large [[Sinkhole|doline]] on Briantspuddle Heath]]
The expansion of the North Atlantic, which first occurred during the [[Triassic]] period, now reached a point where it was affecting the Dorset landscape. Areas that were previously underwater were exposed to erosion as the chalk was folded and forced upwards.&lt;ref name=E69&gt;Ensom (p.69)&lt;/ref&gt; The early deposits from this period, found across South-East England, do not occur in Dorset. The small amounts found in Devon however, coupled with the many [[sinkhole|solution holes]] found across the Dorset chalk, suggests that erosion may have removed them.&lt;ref name=E69-70&gt;Ensom (pp.69-70)&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the larger solution holes, known as dolines, are found on the heaths between [[Dorchester, Dorset|Dorchester]] and [[Bere Regis]]. Near [[Briantspuddle]] is Culpepper's Dish, 86 metres wide and over 21 metres deep.&lt;ref name=E70&gt;Ensom (p.70)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first deposits found from this period in Dorset are the Reading Formation clays. A sub-division of the [[Lambeth Group]], they are visible above the chalk at Studland. Mottled, brightly coloured and generally lacking fossils, the clays are thought to be deposited beneath [[lagoons]].&lt;ref name=E70/&gt; In the east of the county, however, fossilised remains of gastropods and sharks' teeth have been found alongside flint pebbles, clearly identifying these clays as marine deposits.&lt;ref name=E71&gt;Ensom (p.71)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bracklesham Beds|Bracklesham group]], found across much of the Dorset portion of the Hampshire Basin, were mainly deposited by rivers and form the foundations of the Dorset heathland. The frequent and heavy rains which occurred during this period transported large amounts of material from northern uplands across the [[Isle of Purbeck|Purbeck]] and [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]] areas.&lt;ref name=E71/&gt; A thick layer of Chert gravel from the Purbeck Strata can be found on Blackdown Hill near [[Portesham]], but it is not known whether it was carried there or whether it is the remains of an earlier deposit.&lt;ref&gt;Ensom (pp.71-72)&lt;/ref&gt; Blocks of Quartzite can be found across the downlands of Southern Dorset and these sarsons have been used in the some of the local prehistoric monuments.&lt;ref name=E71&gt;Ensom (p.71)&lt;/ref&gt;

To the north and east of the county, much finer sands and gravels are found, including ball clay which was widely mined on the heaths around Wareham.&lt;ref name=E72&gt;Ensom (p.72)&lt;/ref&gt; The fine particles which make up the clay are believed to have originated in the west where rocks were being broken down by the alternating dry, humid conditions and torrential rain, which in turn formed rivers and carried the material to its current position.&lt;ref name=E72/&gt; Overlying the clay is the Agglestone grit, an iron cemented sandstone which forms the [[Agglestone Rock|Agglestone]] near Studland, and has been used in the buildings in and around the heathland where it is found.&lt;ref name=E73&gt;Ensom (p.73)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Stair Hole - geograph.org.uk - 24710.jpg|thumb|The crumpled rock strata at Stair Hole caused by a collision between the African and Eurasian plates]]

Fossilised palms taken from the cliffs at Bournemouth confirm that Dorset had a tropical climate at the time.&lt;ref name=E73/&gt; [[Creech Barrow Hill]] is crowned with a unique early Eocene limestone that has yielded some important fossils. Outcrops of rock from the Barton Group occur along the coast between Bournemouth and [[Hengistbury Head]].&lt;ref name=E74&gt;Ensom (p.74)&lt;/ref&gt;

===45&amp;ndash;1.5 Ma (Eocene &amp;ndash; Pleistocene)===
During this period, Dorset drifted a further 9 degrees north, the climate cooled rapidly and by 37 Ma was [[Temperateness|temperate]].&lt;ref name=E75&gt;Ensom (p.75)&lt;/ref&gt; Mainly terrestrial with fresh and brackish water environments, the county would, despite its low-lying nature, remain largely without marine influences except for some minor incursions at the end of the ice ages. The late [[Palaeogene]] deposits that filled the Hampshire Basin as the sea levels fell are not found in Dorset, nor are the [[Neogene]], which are absent from virtually all of the [[British Isles]].&lt;ref name=E75/&gt;

The collision of the [[African plate|African]] and [[Eurasian plate]]s that occurred around this time caused a violent uplift in the south of the county, the results of which can be seen clearly at [[Stair Hole]], where the strata run almost vertically.&lt;ref&gt;Ensom (pp.75-76)&lt;/ref&gt; Further, but less dramatic folding and uplift, along the county's subsurface faults, coupled with continuing erosion of Jurassic and Cretaceous sediments, created Dorset's modern landscape and drainage patterns.&lt;ref name=E76&gt;Ensom (p.76)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quaternary==

===1.5 Ma&amp;ndash;Present (Pleistocene &amp;ndash; Holocene)===
[[File:Cliffs at the north end of White Hole - geograph.org.uk - 1099825.jpg|thumb|left|Raised beach deposits at [[Portland Raised Beach|White Hole]], Portland]]
During the last 1,500,000 years, Britain was subjected to a number of extreme fluctuations in temperature which included three ice ages. Dorset was not affected by glaciation but did experience very low temperatures with permafrost on the high ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/PDF/SCHO0207BLYB-E-E.pdf|title=The Chalk of Dorset|page=15|work=Baseline chemistry of selected reference aquifers in England and Wales.|publisher= British Geological Survey/Environment Agency|year=2002|accessdate=24 January 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/691Ty3W1c|archivedate=9 July 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ensom (pp.77 - 78)&lt;/ref&gt; Sudden changes in sea-level, and successive warming and cooling, took their toll on the landscape.&lt;ref name=E77&gt;Ensom (p.77)&lt;/ref&gt; The two [[Portland Raised Beach|raised beaches]] at Portland created 210,000 and 125,000 years ago are a dramatic testament to the fluctuations in sea levels. The cause of these two fluctuations was twofold: the growth of the ice, which absorbed large quantities of water, and the weight of the ice in the north that caused the landmass to tilt.&lt;ref name=E78&gt;Ensom (p.78)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer months, partial melting of the ice created large rivers that washed enormous amounts of sand and gravel across the county, forming huge terraces in both the upland areas and valleys.&lt;ref name=E78&gt;Ensom (p.78)&lt;/ref&gt; These rivers cut down into the landscape as they made their way to the lower sea levels. This action caused many large-scale landslips, most notably around  Shaftesbury and Abbotsbury.&lt;ref name=E78/&gt;

Landslips caused by marine erosion still occur today, with some of the largest taking place along the West Dorset Coast. Fossilised remains, including the teeth and tusks of [[Elephantidae|elephants]] and [[mammoth]]s dating back 500,000 years, are often exposed.&lt;ref name=E79&gt;Ensom (p.79)&lt;/ref&gt; Flint and Chert tools from early human visitors have been retrieved from the river terraces around the Dorset and Devon border, although these may have been transported here with the other river deposits.&lt;ref name=E79/&gt; [[Chesil Bank]] a {{convert|29|km|mi|0}} long [[barrier beach]] stretching from [[West Bay]] to Portland, was created 10,000 years ago, when sea levels rose at the end of the last ice age.

==Structure==
[[File:Rock Strata, Durdle Door - geograph.org.uk - 274762.jpg|thumb|Vertical rock strata on the west side of [[St Oswald's Bay]], at the western end of the Purbeck Monocline]]

===Structural development===
The [[Variscan orogeny]] is the oldest event for which there is evidence in Dorset, forming a major series of [[thrust fault]]s in [[Carboniferous]] and older rocks. These thrusts trend west&amp;ndash;east, dip moderately towards the south and have controlled later basin development and subsequent phases of [[inversion (geology)|inversion]]. During the Permo-Triassic the area was affected by a phase of rifting that reactivated the older thrusts in extension.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chadwick&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chadwick|first=R.A.|year=1986|title=Extension tectonics in the Wessex Basin, southern England|journal=Journal of the Geological Society|publisher=[[Geological Society]]|volume=143|pages=465–488|url=http://jgs.lyellcollection.org/content/143/3/465.abstract|accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These extensional faults were themselves reactivated during further rifting in Jurassic to early Cretaceous times. The area experienced the effects of the early stages of Alpine collision during the Late Cretaceous to [[Palaeogene]], with reverse reactivation of many of the extensional faults, creating the most visible of the structures in the Dorset area, such as the Purbeck Monocline.

===Litton Cheney Fault===
The Litton Cheney Fault is a west&amp;ndash;east-trending, south-dipping normal fault. The fault was active during deposition of the Lias Group and again during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous. There is evidence of minor reversal on the fault during the Late Cretaceous to Palaeogene inversion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Butler&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Butler|first=M.|coauthors=|title=The development, evolution and petroleum geology of the Wessex Basin|publisher=[[Geological Society]]|location=London|year=1998|series=Special Publications|volume=133|chapter=The geological history of the southern Wessex Basin — a review of new information from oil exploration|isbn=9781897799994|url=http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/133/1/241.abstract|accessdate=4 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abbotsbury&amp;ndash;Ridgeway Fault===
This major west&amp;ndash;east-trending, south-dipping normal fault was mainly active during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous, as shown by the local preservation of the Wealden in its hanging wall. It was reactivated as a reverse fault during the Late Cretaceous to Palaeogene, and now juxtaposes Portland and Purbeck beds in the hanging wall against Chalk in the footwall. The fault is not directly linked to faults beneath the Triassic salt layer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvey&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Weymouth Anticline.png|thumb|Cross-section over the Weymouth Anticline|260px]]

===Weymouth Anticline===
The Weymouth Anticline has a west&amp;ndash;east trending axis and plunges to the east. Strata beneath the Upper Triassic halite are unfolded indicating that the salt is acting as a [[decollement]]. The anticline is a result of inversion along the Abbotsbury&amp;ndash;Ridgeway Fault, although it has been suggested that it developed by the tightening of an earlier rollover anticline, formed during an earlier extensional phase, due to the [[Salt_tectonics#Salt_detached_fault_systems|soft-linked nature]] of the faulting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvey&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Harvey|first=M.J.|coauthors=Stewart S.A.|title=The development, evolution and petroleum geology of the Wessex Basin|publisher=[[Geological Society]]|location=London|year=1998|series=Special Publications|volume=133|chapter=Influence of salt on the structural evolution of the Channel Basin|isbn=9781897799994|url=http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/133/1/67.abstract|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John William Leckie''' (born 23 October 1949 in [[Paddington]], [[London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creditgate.com/companysearch/john+leckie+music+limited.aspx |title=John Leckie Music Limited |publisher=Creditgate |date= |accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Professor Footprint |url=http://www.dellam.com/cgi-bin/main.pl?web=yes&amp;foundnumber=03978670 |title=Dellam Corporate Information Limited, England |location=51.350638;-0.19093 |publisher=Dellam.com |date= |accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an English [[music producer]], and [[recording engineer]].

==Early career==
Leckie began work at [[Abbey Road Studios]] on 15 February 1970 as a Tape-Operator, later graduating to Balance Engineer.&lt;ref name=&quot;eandt.theiet.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eandt.theiet.org/magazine/2011/11/interview-john-leckie.cfm |title=Interview - John Leckie, record producer - E &amp; T Magazine |publisher=Eandt.theiet.org |date= |accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this early career he worked with artists such as [[John Lennon]] (''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]]''), [[George Harrison]], (''[[All Things Must Pass]]''), [[Syd Barrett]] (''[[Barrett (album)|Barrett]]'') and [[Pink Floyd]] (''[[Meddle]]'' and ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musictank.co.uk/resources/speaker-biographies/john-leckie-producer |title=John Leckie - Producer — MusicTank |publisher=Musictank.co.uk |date=15 February 1970 |accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Paul McCartney]]'s [[Wings (band)|Wings]] Leckie worked on ''[[Red Rose Speedway]]'' and the single &quot;[[Hi, Hi, Hi]]&quot;. He mixed [[Be-Bop Deluxe]]'s début album  ''[[Axe Victim]]''. His first job as producer was the same band's third album ''[[Sunburst Finish (album)|Sunburst Finish]]'', which collaboration continued through ''Modern Music'', ''Live! In The Air Age'' and ''[[Drastic Plastic]]''.

Leckie left Abbey Road in 1978 and produced albums for [[Simple Minds]] (''[[Life in a Day (album)|Life in a Day]]'', ''[[Real to Real Cacophony]]'' and ''[[Empires and Dance]]'') and [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]] (''[[Real Life (Magazine album)|Real Life]]''). For [[Be-Bop Deluxe]] founder [[Bill Nelson (musician)|Bill Nelson]], he produced the [[Bill Nelson's Red Noise|Red Noise]] album ''Sound on Sound'' and Nelson's subsequent solo album ''Quit Dreaming And Get On The Beam'' (the latter unreleased until 1981). Leckie recorded the début single, ''[[Public Image (song)|Public Image]]'' for [[Public Image Ltd]]. Leckie's work with [[XTC]] included ''3D-EP'', as well as the band's later albums: ''[[White Music]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;SOS&quot; /&gt; ''[[Go 2]]'', ''[[25 O'Clock]]'' and ''[[Psonic Psunspot]]'' which XTC issued under the pseudonym [[The Dukes of Stratosphear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ape.uk.net/podcast/2009/03/andy-partridge-chats-with-john-leckie-part-one/ |title=Andy Partridge's Ape House Label » Andy Partridge Chats With John Leckie – Part One |publisher=Ape.uk.net |date=31 March 2009 |accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some of his work with The Dukes, The Adult Net and The Doctor's Children, all bands that had strong 1960s psychedelic overtones, Leckie adopted the pseudonym 'Swami Anand Nagara'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://huffduffer.com/twelvety/16273 |title=Andy Partridge Chats With John Leckie - Part Two on Huffduffer |publisher=Huffduffer.com |date= |accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 he produced [[Felt]]'s album [[The Strange Idols Pattern and Other Short Stories]]. 

In 1989 Leckie produced [[The Stone Roses]]' debut album ''[[The Stone Roses (album)|The Stone Roses]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Devlin&quot;&gt;Devlin, Louise (2009) &quot;[http://www.theskinny.co.uk/article/45846-john-leckie-producing-the-goods John Leckie: Producing the Goods]&quot;, ''[[The Skinny (magazine)|The Skinny]]'', 19 May 2009, retrieved 7 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The album was voted the best record of all time on a music poll taken by [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] and features as Number 1 on [[the Observer Music Monthly]]’s June 2004 “100 Greatest British Albums”.

==1990s==
Leckie was named ''Best Producer'' by [[Music Week]] (1995) and at the [[Q Awards]] (1996) and [[Brit Awards]] (1997).&lt;ref name=&quot;SOS&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/1997_articles/may97/johnleckie.html True brit: John Leckie]&quot;, ''[[Sound on Sound]]'', May 1997, retrieved 7 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

This would be the band's last album not to be recorded in full by [[Nigel Godrich]], an assistant engineer present during Leckie's work on [[The Bends]].

Leckie's work during the 1990s widened considerably to include the work of [[Dr John]] (''Anutha Zone'').&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mikecollins.plus.com/PUBLICATIONS/PDFS/John%20Leckie%20Interview.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent career==
In 1999 he produced the début album ''[[Showbiz (album)|Showbiz]]'' for Taste Media’s then new signings [[Muse (band)|Muse]]. This went platinum on the heels of the band's breakthrough 2001 second album ''[[Origin of Symmetry]]'', also produced by Leckie, which reached No. 3 in the UK album Chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/music/features/45846-john_leckie_producing_goods |title=John Leckie: Producing the Goods |publisher=The Skinny |date=19 May 2009 |accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 he began production on ''&quot;Wildflowers&quot;'' the debut album from [[Northern Ireland]] band ''[[Relish (Northern Irish band)|Relish]]''.

Leckie then returned to [[Abbey Road]] to record and produce the jazz sounds of [[Portico Quartet]] and was also called in to remaster the Anniversary Edition Box Set of [[The Stone Roses]] eponymous first LP complete with his videos of the sessions and some long lost demos. Leckie also appeared in TV's Classic Album Series playing and commenting on tapes from [[Plastic Ono Band]] sessions he had worked on some 40 years previously at [[Abbey Road Studios]].{{cn|date=February 2014}} In 2010, Leckie produced [[The Coral]]'s album, ''[[Butterfly House (album)|Butterfly House]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/indy-choice-best-of-the-new-music-2022787.html?action=gallery&amp;ino=4 |title=The Coral, Butterfly House (Deltasonic) 'I can't quite put my finger on th |publisher=The Independent |date=9 July 2010 |accessdate=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which went on to win Album of the Year at Music Producer's Guild Awards.

'''Ronnie O'Brien''' (born 5 January 1979 in [[Bray]], Republic of Ireland) is a retired Irish [[Association football|footballer]] who last played for the [[San Jose Earthquakes]].

==Playing career==
O'Brien's footballing career began very promisingly, when at the age of 18 he signed a contract with [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] of the [[FA Premier League]]. Although he played little at Middlesbrough, he had great success with [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Irish national team]] youth sides, winning the [[UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship|European U-16 championship]] alongside players like [[Damien Duff]] and [[Robbie Keane]]. After two years with [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], O'Brien was released on a free transfer. Incredibly, Italian giants [[Juventus]] offered 20-year-old O'Brien a five-year contract; however, he had trouble getting playing time on such a talented side and was loaned out to [[A.C. Lugano|Lugano]] of Switzerland, [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] of [[Scotland]], and lower league Italian sides [[F.C. Crotone|Crotone]] and [[Calcio Lecco 1912|Lecco]]. After several years of disappointment and three Inter-Toto Cup appearances, O'Brien was released from his contract with Juventus in 2002.

===MLS===
In search of consistent playing time, O'Brien, made the unconventional decision to move to America to join the Dallas Burn. O'Brien made an immediate impact, scoring on his debut for the club in a [[US Open Cup]] match. He finished the 2002 season with two goals and two assists in 11 games but had proven himself one of the more dynamic players on the team. O'Brien entered the 2003 season with great expectations, but these were cut short early in the season. In the Burn's third game of the season, a tackle from [[D.C. United]]'s [[Dema Kovalenko]] broke O'Brien's tibia, effectively ending his season. O'Brien returned to the team in 2004 and was one of the team's offensive leaders – he started 29 games, registering two goals and 10 assists, was named to the [[MLS Best XI]], and helped revitalise a Burn team that had recorded one of the league's worst records ever in the previous season.

In 2005, O'Brien repeated his Best XI form, finishing the year with six goals and 12 assists. During the 2006 season, O'Brien clashed with FC Dallas' head coach [[Colin Clarke (footballer born 1962)|Colin Clarke]] all season. His form was poor and he finished with only one goal in 27 games. At the conclusion of the season, O'Brien was traded to the expansion club [[Toronto FC]] with a gentlemen's agreement that Toronto FC would not draft any other FC Dallas players.

Due to a knee injury during a training session, which was later aggravated during a friendly match, O'Brien was limited to 13 games in the 2007 season.

In 2008, O'Brien was traded to the San Jose Earthquakes. In return, Toronto FC received San Jose's first round pick in the 2009 draft plus an undisclosed amount of money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestar.com/Sports/Soccer/article/307761 |title=TFC trades O'Brien to Earthquakes: Report |first=Morgan |last=Campbell |date=28 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made 28 appearances, scoring 4 goals (his 16th in the MLS). His 6 assists brought his MLS career assist total to 45 (from 142 total appearances).

Following O'Brien's strong performance and evident leadership in 2008, the San Jose Earthquakes stunned their fans by failing to pick up his contract option for the 2009 season. Instead, Earthquakes' GM John Doyle was hoping that he would accept a substantial pay cut. In January 2009, O'Brien made it known that he would not be returning to the [[San Jose Earthquakes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centerlinesoccer.com/obrienim-definitely-not-coming-back/ |title=O'Brien: &quot;I'm definitely not coming back&quot; |first=Jeff |last=Carlisle |date=22 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without O'Brien's leadership and strong play, the Earthquakes struggled early in 2009. Despite a favourable schedule in which San Jose played five of their seven games at home, the Quakes managed just one win, leading many San Jose fans to call for O'Brien's return.

O'Brien keeps an off-season residence in Dallas and is an avid [[Dallas Mavericks]] fan.
His profile page on the MLS site stated that he had retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/player/ronnie-obrien |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110427212529/http://www.mlssoccer.com/player/ronnie-obrien |archivedate=27 April 2011 |title=Ronnie O'Brien}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is now a coach of FC Dallas' youth teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |url=http://vimeo.com/10414889 |year=2010 |author=FC Dallas |title=Spring Break Youth Soccer Camp |type=Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Despite having played multiple times for the Irish underage sides, O'Brien only received one callup to the senior side. [[Steve Staunton]] contacted Toronto FC about his availability for a short tour of the US in June 2007. However, O'Brien turned down the chance to play for his country again, as he had just returned from injury, while adding he was happy playing club football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=433303&amp;root=mls&amp;&amp;cc=5739 |title=O'Brien has no regrets about declining Irish invite |first=Doug |last=McIntyre |date=24 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Time'' magazine stunt==

In August 1999, e-mails circulated urging Irish people to vote for Ronnie O'Brien in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']]'s [[Person of the Century]] Internet poll, causing O'Brien to lead the poll, above those such as [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Martin Luther King]]. After the poll crashed due to attracting too much traffic, ''Time'' removed O'Brien from the running, restating the rule that &quot;whimsical candidates will not be counted.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;archives.tcm.ie&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2003/04/06/story218107692.asp |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090301024355/http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2003/04/06/story218107692.asp |archivedate=1 March 2009 |title=Polling power of viral e-mails |date=6 April 2003 |first=Mark |last=Wrafter }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation''', also known as '''Farmer Mac''' ({{nyse|AGM}}), is a stockholder-owned, publicly traded company that was chartered by the United States federal government in 1988 to serve as a [[secondary market]] in agricultural loans such as [[mortgage loan|mortgages]] for agricultural real estate and rural housing. The company purchases loans from agricultural lenders, and sells instruments backed by those loans. The company also works with the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]. It is based in [[Washington, D.C.]]

It was created by the [[Agricultural Credit Act of 1987]] (P.L. 100-233) as a federally chartered, private corporation responsible for guaranteeing the timely repayment of principal and interest to investors in a new agricultural secondary market. The secondary market allows a lending institution to sell a qualified farm real estate loan to an agricultural mortgage marketing facility, or pooler, which packages these loans, and sells to investors securities that are backed by, or represent interests in, the pooled loans. Farmer Mac guarantees the timely repayment of principal and interest on these securities and, under authorities granted in 1995, can also serve as a loan pooler.

'''USS ''Groton'' (SSN-694)''', a [[Los Angeles class submarine|''Los Angeles''-class submarine]], was the third ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for [[Groton, Connecticut]]. The contract to build her was awarded to the [[Electric Boat]] Division of [[General Dynamics]] Corporation in [[Groton, Connecticut]] on 31 January 1971 and her keel was laid down on 3 August 1973. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 9 October 1976 sponsored by Mrs. Elliot L. Richardson, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 8 July 1978, with Commander R. William Vogel, III in command and Master Chief Petty Officer Joseph Pow as Chief of the Boat.

''Groton'' departed on its first overseas deployment in March 1980 to the Indian Ocean. The submarine made its way back to the homeport of Groton, CT by way of the Panama Canal. ''Groton'' completed the Around-the-World Cruise in October 1980.

''Groton'' was decommissioned and stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 7 November 1997. Ex-''Groton'' is scheduled to enter the Nuclear Powered [[Ship and Submarine Recycling Program]] in [[Bremerton, Washington]].

'''USS ''Birmingham'' (SSN-695)''', a [[Los Angeles class submarine|''Los Angeles''-class submarine]], was the third ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. The contract to build her was awarded to [[Northrop Grumman Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company]] in [[Newport News, Virginia]] on 24 January 1972 and her keel was laid down on 26 April 1975.  She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 29 October 1977 sponsored by Mrs. Maryon Allen, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 16 December 1978, with Commander Paul L. Callahan in command.

''Birmingham'' was decommissioned and stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 22 December 1997. Ex-''Birmingham'' is scheduled to enter the Nuclear Powered [[Ship and Submarine Recycling Program]] in [[Bremerton, Washington]].

== In fiction ==
Footage taken during the commissioning trials for the USS ''Birmingham'' was used in the film ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]''.  The hull number (SSN-695) is easily readable on the submarine in the film.  This denotes that the footage was taken during commissioning trials as the numbers are removed before active service.

&lt;!--
:''17 years of history go here''
--&gt;
On 11 March 1999, ''Bremerton'' used one torpedo to sink the derelict forebody of the merchant ship ''[[New Carissa]]'' off the [[Oregon]] coast. The [[USS David R. Ray (DD-971)|USS ''David R. Ray'']] also participated in the sinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/archives/1999/9903120070.asp NEW CARISSA IS FINALLY BURIED AT SEA]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--
:''at least seven years of history go here''
--&gt;
After a successful Western Pacific deployment, in September 2003 ''Bremerton'' changed its homeport to [[Pearl Harbor, Hawaii]]. ''Bremerton'' spent two months in [[drydock]] at Pearl Harbor ending 21 January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/20100127/GETPUBLISHED/1270388 Pearl Harbor Shipyard Undocks USS Bremerton]&lt;/ref&gt;

When {{USS|Los Angeles|SSN-688}} was decommissioned on 23 January 2010, ''Bremerton'' became the oldest commissioned submarine in the US fleet. On that day, [[Richard O'Kane]]'s [[cribbage]] board was transferred from ''Los Angeles'' to ''Bremerton'', a tradition that dates back to [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Press-Telegram|title=USS Los Angeles Decommissioning|author=Steven Georges|date=23 January 2010|url=http://presstelegram.mycapture.com/mycapture/enlarge.asp?image=27658244&amp;event=930342&amp;CategoryID=28570}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''USS ''Jacksonville'' (SSN-699)''', a [[Los Angeles class submarine|''Los Angeles''-class]] [[attack submarine]], is the only ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. The ship is nicknamed &quot;The Bold One&quot;. The contract to build her was awarded to the [[Electric Boat]] Division of [[General Dynamics]] Corporation in [[Groton, Connecticut]] on 24 January 1972 and her keel was laid down on 21 February 1976. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 18 November 1978 using the pontoon system designed for the launching of the Ohio Class Trident Submarines. The Jacksonville was sponsored by Mrs. Charles E. Bennett, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 16 May 1981, with Captain Robert B. Wilkinson in command.

''Jacksonville''’s operations have included a variety of fleet exercises and deployments including two around-the-world cruises in 1982 and 1985, deployments to the western [[Atlantic Ocean]] in 1983, 1986, 1993 and 1994, and deployments to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in 1987 and 1993. In 1988, Jacksonville participated in a shock trials test program for Los Angeles class submarines, which was followed by a three-year major modernization overhaul in Norfolk Naval Shipyard.

''Jacksonville'' has been involved in several collisions with other vessels during her over 30 years of operation:

:(1)  While outbound with the inbound Turkish merchant vessel ''General Z. Dogan'' in the vicinity of Norfolk, Virginia on 22 March 1982,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.navy.mil/shiphist/j/ssn-699/1982.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

:(2)  with a barge positioned across [[Chesapeake Bay]]'s Thimble Shoal Channel, requiring the replacement of the submarine's sonar dome, on 21 September 1984,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.navy.mil/shiphist/j/ssn-699/1983-84.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

:(3)  with the container ship ''Saudi Makkah'' near the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, requiring repairs to the submarine's fairwater planes and rudder, on 17 May 1996,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.navy.mil/shiphist/j/ssn-699/1996.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.dailypress.com/1996-05-18/news/9605180038_1_coast-guard-saudi-arabia-saudi-makkah&lt;/ref&gt; and 

:(4)  with an unnamed fishing vessel while on regular patrol in the Persian Gulf on 10 January 2013.  The ship's main periscope was sheared off in the collision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hawaii-Based US Navy Sub Damaged in Persian Gulf |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2013/01/10/us/ap-us-submarine-periscope-damaged.html |newspaper=New York Times |location=Honolulu |date=10 January 2013 |accessdate=12 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 December 2004 a small fire broke out aboard ''Jacksonville'' while she was undergoing a [[refueling overhaul]] at the [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]]. The fire was immediately extinguished and the reactor was never in danger, though a shipyard firefighter and a sailor were treated at the scene for [[smoke inhalation]].

{{otherships|USS Norfolk}}

'''USS ''Norfolk'' (SSN-714)''', a [[Los Angeles class submarine|''Los Angeles''-class]] [[attack submarine]], was the third ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. The contract to build her was awarded to [[Northrop Grumman Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company]] in [[Newport News, Virginia]] on 20 February 1976 and her keel was laid down on 1 August 1979. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 31 October 1981 sponsored by Mrs. [[Caspar Weinberger]], and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 21 May 1983, with Commander Kenneth R. Karr in command (Commander Karr was promoted to the Pentagon later that year and retired from the NPEB as a Captain in 1988).

With the second Commanding Officer, Alfred Ponessa, ''Norfolk'' conducted extensive trials of the next-generation torpedo, ADCAP, as well as advanced and secret acoustic experiments.  The ship also made an active deployment during one of the final spurts of activity from the declining Soviet navy. On 23 July 1988 the USS Norfolk fired the first ADCAP torpedo, sinking the [[USS_Jonas_Ingram_(DD-938)|USS ''Jonas Ingram'' (DD-938)]]. Commander Ponessa was succeeded by Commander Harrop in 1988. 

On 17 January 1989, ''Norfolk'' was involved in a collision with the [[combat stores ship]] [[USS San Diego (AFS-6)|USS ''San Diego'' (AFS-6)]] off Cape Charles Light, VA as both vessels were headed to sea.  ''Norfolk'' was outbound for an engineering inspection, an event which occupied all of the ships most experienced officers.  The Officer of the Deck was the ship's most junior officer, a non-nuclear-trained Lieutenant Junior-Grade, and the Commanding Officer himself was new to the ship, sick and hoarse that day.  While trying to pass the ''San Diego'' in a turn in the channel, the current set ''Norfolk'' towards an outer buoy on the port side. Overcorrecting for this event, ''Norfolk'' delivered a glancing blow to the ship on her starboard side, ''San Diego''. There were no injuries, and neither ship suffered significant structural damage.  Upon returning to dockside later that day, ''Norfolk's '' commanding officer was relieved, and the sub proceeded on the surface to [[Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay|Kings Bay, Georgia]], for inspection and repairs.  As a result of this collision, COMSUBLANT issued orders limiting submarine speed and passing activities while in the restricted waters of the Hampton Roads channels.

On 25 August 2004, ''Norfolk'' returned to [[Naval Station Norfolk|Norfolk, VA]] after a 22-month [[Refueling and Overhaul|Engineering Refueling Overhaul]] (ERO) at [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]] in [[Kittery, Maine]].

'''USS ''Buffalo'' (SSN-715)''', a {{sclass|Los Angeles|submarine}}, was the second ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for [[Buffalo, New York]] (another {{USS|Buffalo|1813|6}} was named for the [[American Bison|animal]]). The contract to build her was awarded to [[Northrop Grumman Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company]] in [[Newport News, Virginia]] on 23 February 1976 and her keel was laid down on 25 January 1980.  She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 8 May 1982 sponsored by Mrs. Joanne Kemp, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 5 November 1983, with Commander G. Michael Hewitt in command.

In 1999, ''Buffalo'' was modified to carry a [[Dry Deck Shelter]] (DDS).  In 2002, the ''Buffalo'' entered drydock in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii and became the first ship to undergo nuclear refueling in Hawaii.  In late November 2005, the DDS was used to launch an underwater glider capable of gathering and storing information to be later transmitted by means of a built-in satellite phone.

On 10 June 2008, ''Buffalo'' visited [[Olongapo City]] in the [[Philippines]], allowing Filipino children to tour her.[http://www.ctf74.navy.mil/imagery/2008/06a.htm]

Per the Annual Report to Congress on Long-Range Planning for Construction of Naval Vessels for FY2013, ''Buffalo'' is scheduled for decommissioning in 2017.[http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/dangerroom/2012/03/navy-shipbuilding-fy2013.pdf]

'''USS ''Honolulu'' (SSN-718)''', was a [[Los Angeles class submarine|''Los Angeles''-class submarine]], was the third ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for [[Honolulu, Hawaii]]. The contract to build her was awarded to [[Northrop Grumman Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company]] in [[Newport News, Virginia]] on 15 September 1977 and her keel was laid down on 10 November 1981. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 24 September 1983 sponsored by Mrs. Joan B. Clark, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 6 July 1985, with Commander Robert M. Mitchell in command.

[[Image:Polar bears near north pole.jpg|300px|left|thumb|Three [[polar bear]]s approach ''Honolulu''{{'}}s [[starboard]] [[Bow (ship)|bow]] while she is on the surface 280 nautical miles (519 kilometers) from the [[North Pole]].]]''Honolulu'' featured unique split stern planes that operated from independent hydraulic systems. With this redundant configuration, the inboard and outboard planes could be operated independently, preventing a failure of one or the other from causing an uncontrolled dive.

''Honolulu''’s patrols are commemorated by ten [[surfboard]]s signed by the crews aboard her at the time.  The latest three are kept on board the submarine; the other seven are stored at [[Pearl Harbor]].

''Honolulu'' held a farewell ceremony in Pearl Harbor on 15 April 2006, that included remarks by Senator [[Daniel K. Inouye]], Lieutenant Governor [[James Aiona]], U.S. Pacific Fleet commander Admiral [[Gary Roughead]] and former ''Honolulu'' commanding officer Vice Admiral [[Jonathan Greenert]].  ''Honolulu'' put to sea in early May 2006 for her final patrol. Her last patrol ended at [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] in October 2006 where she was placed on stand down, on her way to decommissioning.

==Final Deposition==
''Honolulu'' was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] and stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 2 November 2007. Ex-''Honolulu'' entered the [[Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program]] in [[Bremerton, Washington]].

The forward section of ex-''Honolulu'' was transferred to [[USS San Francisco (SSN-711)|USS ''San Francisco'' (SSN-711)]], repairing extensive damage caused by a severe grounding ''San Francisco'' experienced in 2005. The &quot;challenging, one-of-a-kind project&quot; was completed on 20 October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=40390 |title=USS San Francisco Undocks With New Bow |date=20 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Robinson R22''' is a two-bladed, single-engine light utility [[helicopter]] manufactured by [[Robinson Helicopter]]. The two-seat R22 was designed in 1973 by [[Frank D. Robinson|Frank Robinson]] and has been in production since 1979.

The R22 has a suggested retail price of $270,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=R22 Pricelist|url=http://www.robinsonheli.com/price_lists_eocs/r22_pricelist.pdf|publisher=Robinson Helicopter Company|accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is valued from $40,000 on the second hand market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robinson R22 Helicopters for Sale|url=http://www.globalaircraftmarket.com/en/helicopter/_/Robinson?family=R22|accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The majority of flight testing was performed at [[Zamperini Field]] in [[Torrance, California]]. Flight testing and certification was performed in the late 1970’s by test pilot [[Joseph John &quot;Tym&quot; Tymczyszyn]] and the R22 received FAA certification in March 1979. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Aerospace Walk of Honor: &quot;Tymczyszyn Bio&quot;] |url= http://www.cityoflancasterca.org/Index.aspx?page=196#tym|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to relatively low acquisition and operating costs, the R22 has been popular as a primary rotorcraft trainer around the world and as a livestock management tool on large [[ranch]]es in [[North America]] and [[cattle station]]s in [[Australia]].  The R22 has a very low inertia rotor system and the control inputs are operated directly by push rods with no hydraulic assistance.  Thus, the flight controls are very sensitive and require a light touch to avoid over correcting. A student that masters an R22 generally does not have a problem transitioning to a heavier helicopter. Due to the issues relating to a low inertia rotor-system and a teetering main rotor, operation by any pilot in the United States of the Robinson R22 or [[Robinson R44]] requires a special endorsement by a certified flight instructor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=667dbf9e08b795564f0fc685a46bf054&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:2.0.1.1.2&amp;idno=14#14:2.0.1.1.2.0.1.1.7 SFAR No. 73 to Part 61 in the Federal Aviation Regulations]&lt;/ref&gt; Tip weights were added to increase rotor inertia,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unicopter.com/0385.html&lt;/ref&gt; but the small rotor limits weight.&lt;ref&gt;Borrows, David A. [http://flighttraining.aopa.org/magazine/1998/March/199803_Features_Rotor_RPM_.html Rotor RPM] ''Flight Training'', March 1998. Accessed: February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[Image:robinson.r22.g-cbxn.arp.jpg|thumb|right|Robinson R22 hovering]]

The R-22 is a light, two-place, single reciprocating-engined helicopter with a semi-rigid two-bladed main rotor and a two-bladed tail rotor. The main rotor has a teetering hinge and two coning hinges, the tail rotor has only a teetering hinge.

The normal production variant has skid landing gear. The Mariner version provided floats; wheeled gear is not available.

The basic structure is welded [[41xx steel|chromoly steel]] tubing. The forward fuselage is made of fiberglass and aluminum with a Plexiglas canopy.  The tailcone, vertical and horizontal stabilizers are aluminum. It has an enclosed cabin with side-by-side seating for a pilot and passenger. The doors may be removed for flight, and are often done so for photographic flights, interior cooling in high temperatures, or a 10.4&amp;nbsp;lb weight saving.

The first version was produced as the R22, followed by the R22 HP, R22 Alpha, R22 Beta and R22 Beta II. Superficially, the aircraft appear similar.  The R22 HP was fitted with a 160 [[horsepower#Brake horsepower|bhp]] Lycoming 0-320-B2C engine, an increase of {{convert|10|bhp|abbr=on}} over the original R22.  The landing skid assembly on the R22 Alpha was modified by extending the rear struts, giving it a slightly nose-down attitude on the ground and better matching its attitude in a low altitude hover with two people on board.  The R22 Beta added an engine speed governor (optional), rotor brake and auxiliary fuel tank (optional). The battery was moved from below the instrument cluster to the engine compartment for better balance. It has been offered as an instrument trainer version, with optional fixed floats as the R22 Mariner, and other special configurations for police work, electronic news gathering, and so on.  The R22 Beta II added a Lycoming 0-360 engine, remade of lightweight materials and derated for sealevel operation.  It allows greater altitudes for hovering in and out of ground effect (HIGE/HOGE).  The R22 Beta II also made the engine speed governor standard and included a &quot;carb heat assist&quot; which correlates adding carb heat with decrease in collective control.  Only the basic skid style is currently being sold.  The R44 is available as the Clipper with floats, and as police and electronic news configurations.

===Controls===
[[Image:Robinson R22 Cockpit-001.jpg|thumb|The R22's cockpit, showing its unique &quot;T-Bar&quot; control.]]

Instead of floor-mounted cyclic sticks between the pilot's knees, the R22 uses a unique teetering &quot;T-Bar&quot; control connected to a stick that emerges from the console between the seats.  This makes it easier for occupants to enter and exit the cabin and reduces chances for injury in the event of a hard landing.  The teeter bar has a hand grip on both sides that hangs down between the pilots' legs.  Thus, if teetered to the right, the right side pilot would be flying and the left grip would be about 12&amp;nbsp;inches above the left pilot's lap.  R22 flight instructors quickly learn how to fly with their hand in the air.  The left part of the bar, left collective control, and left tail rotor pedals can be removed if the left seat occupant is not certificated to fly the R22 or the space is needed for technical or observer duties. A floor-mounted foot activated push-to-talk switch facilitates intercom communications for the left seat occupant, although some later models may be equipped with a voice activated intercom system.

The [[helicopter rotor]] system consists of a two-bladed main rotor and two-bladed anti-torque rotor on the tail, each equipped with a teetering hinge.  The main rotor is equipped with two coning hinges.  Collective and cyclic pitch inputs to the main rotor are transmitted through pushrods and a conventional [[Swashplate (helicopter)|swashplate]] mechanism.  Control inputs to the pre-coned tail rotor are transmitted through a single pushrod inside the aluminum tail cone.

To ease the pilot's workload, a mechanical throttle correlator adjusts the throttle as the [[collective pitch]] control is raised or lowered.  The pilot only needs to make small adjustments by twisting the throttle grip on the collective throughout the flight regime.  Later models are also equipped with an electronic [[governor (device)|governor]] which works to maintain RPM within normal operating limits (between 97 and 104% RPM); the governor is only active when the engine is running above 80% RPM, and is most effective in normal flight conditions.  The governor can be switched on or off with a toggle switch located at the end of the pilot's collective pitch control; when the governor is not engaged, a yellow caution light glows on the instrument panel.&lt;ref name=&quot;RTR 061&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =Robinson Helicopter Company | first = | coauthors = | title =R22 Pilot’s Operating Handbook and FAA Approved Rotorcraft Flight Manual | publisher = | date = 1996-10-22 | pages = 2–2, 7–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Powerplant===
[[Image:Robinson R22 engine detail.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lycoming O-320]] mounted in a Robinson R-22 Beta]]
[[File:Robinson R22 Helicopter hovering.jpg|thumb|The R22 is a simple and tight design]]

The R22 uses a horizontally mounted [[Lycoming O-320]] (O-360-J2A on the Beta II), [[four-cylinder]], [[air-cooled]], [[normally aspirated]], [[carburetor]]-equipped [[piston engine]].  It is fueled with 100LL grade aviation gasoline.  Cooling is provided through a direct drive [[Centrifugal fan|squirrel-cage]] cooling fan.  At sea level it is capable of producing more power than the transmission and rotor system can safely handle, and to ensure maximum engine and transmission life the O-360 must be [[derating|derated]], or operated at less than maximum power.  As the air becomes thinner with increasing altitude, maximum available horse power decreases, reaching a point where the throttle can be completely open and rotor RPM is controlled by [[Collective pitch#Collective|collective]] position.  By derating the engine at sea level, the R22 achieves acceptable high-altitude performance without use of [[supercharger|supercharging]] or [[turbocharger|turbocharging]], thus saving the weight, complexity, unreliability, and shortened engine life of a [[forced induction]] system.

A [[carburetor]] is used to provide the air-fuel mixture.  Carbureted engines are susceptible to carburetor icing, a condition most likely to occur in conditions of low {{convert|11|C|F}} difference between the outside air temperature and [[dew point]] (the &quot;dew point spread&quot;), as well as visible signs of moisture in the atmosphere.  Icing can lead to loss of engine power, and if not corrected total shutdown of the engine.  A carburetor heat control is used to supply heated air to the carburetor from the exhaust muffler [[heat exchanger]]; this can prevent or cure icing, but also causes a reduction in engine power output because hot air is less dense, enriching the fuel-air mixture.  The carburetor heat control is a simple plunger-type control mounted on the center console near the cyclic; pulling the control up slides a gate near the carburetor that admits warm air from a shroud surrounding the muffler.  The R22 employs a carburetor air temperature gauge, marked to indicate temperatures conducive to icing.  The Beta II version of the R22 also includes a &quot;carburetor heat assist&quot;, which automatically applies carburetor heat when the [[Collective pitch#Collective|collective]] is lowered below a certain point.  When icing conditions are present carburetor heat is required to prevent icing around the butterfly valve from the pressure drop at that point.  As the carburetor air temperature (CAT) indicator does not read correctly below {{convert|18|in|cm}} of intake manifold air pressure, icing conditions require applying full carburetor heat below {{convert|18|in|cm}} of manifold pressure.  A placard indicating this requirement is located on the CAT indicator and in the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH).

Power is transmitted from the engine to the rotor system through [[Belt (mechanical)|drive belts]].  Originally, the R22 used four separate [[V-belt#Vee belts|v-belts]].  This system proved problematic, as belt length variations due to manufacturing tolerances caused some belts to overstress and break.  As a temporary measure, in 1982, R22 operators received a kit from Robinson that was installed in the cockpit and clutch [[worm drive|worm-gear]] motor, isolating the tensioning circuits and locking the clutch/drive system at take-off tension. The problem was ultimately solved by replacing the four individual v-belts with two dual-v belts, running on matching multi-groove sheaves.  The upper driven sheave is mounted on the tail rotor drive shaft next to a flexible coupling and is raised and lowered relative to the engine-mounted driving sheave by means of a small electric gear motor.  During shutdown, the gear motor is used to lower the top sheave to loosen the drive belts.  For startup, the engine is started with the belts loose, allowing the engine to run without spinning the rotor system.  Immediately after engine start, the clutch switch located in the cockpit is closed by the pilot, powering the gear motor to slowly move the top sheave up to flight position, which tightens the belts.  The gear motor is thereafter controlled by a pressure-sensing switch, automatically maintaining proper belt tension during flight as the belts warm up and stretch.  The tail rotor drive shaft is also driven by the main transmission; the semi-conical gear box delivers power to the main rotor shaft through a pair of splash-lubricated [[spiral bevel gear]]s.

A [[sprag clutch]] is built into the center of the top sheave to allow the rotor system to continue to rotate in the event of engine failure, allowing the R22 to enter [[autorotation (helicopter)|autorotation]] and land in a controlled manner.  Because the main rotor has very little mass and inertia, autorotation in an R22 requires careful and proper execution to assure a successful outcome.  Much time is spent in training practicing various types of autorotation.  Target speed in an autorotation is {{convert|65|kn|km/h|abbr=on}} and the glide ratio is approximately 4:1 in maximum-glide configuration.

== Transport ==
[[Image:R22-Trailered.jpg|thumb|right|Robinson R22 helicopter on 8&amp;nbsp;x 30-foot (2.4&amp;nbsp;x 9.1 m) trailer with a gross weight of {{Convert|3500|lb|kg}}.]]
The two-bladed rotor and the small size of the R22 make it possible to transport the helicopter without blade folding or dismantling tasks. Transporting the R22 requires securing the tail boom and rotor blades to the truck or trailer bed,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} which must be torsionally rigid to prevent motion and stresses being applied to the helicopter during transportation. It is possible to take off from and land directly onto a trailer.

== Unmanned derivatives ==
The R22 is the basis for [[Boeing]]'s Maverick military [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] helicopter, and its Renegade version. In 1999, Frontier Systems developed a remotely piloted R22, the Maverick. This aircraft, along with the company, was later acquired by [[Boeing Phantom Works]]. In 2003 the [[United States Navy]] purchased four aircraft, equipped with Wescam EO/IR (Electro-Optical/Infrared) systems.&lt;ref name=ds&gt;[http://www.designation-systems.net/dusrm/app4/maverick.html Boeing Maverick at Designation Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;

Boeing then modified one of the Mavericks further, calling it the Renegade, under contract with [[DARPA]] as a research testbed to develop software for its [[Boeing A160 Hummingbird|A160 Hummingbird]].&lt;ref name=ds/&gt; The software system, known as the Software Enabled Control (SEC) program, was developed by Boeing and teams from the [[University of California Berkeley]], [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and was first flown on May 26, 2005. During the flight, the SEC assumed control of the aircraft to &quot;execute autonomous maneuvering algorithms&quot;.&lt;ref name=boeing1&gt;[http://www.boeing.com/phantom/news/2005/q2/nr_050621a.html Boeing Team Demonstrates Advanced Autonomous Flight Control for UAVs &quot;Boeing Team Demonstrates Advanced Autonomous Flight Control for UAVs&quot; Boeing news release, June 21, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The software allows the aircraft to autonomously select &quot;optimal routes through a field of pop-up and already-known threats; flying low-level, terrain-hugging profiles to avoid detection; and determining safe landing zones by using vision-based algorithms to process landing site imagery and terrain height information.&quot;&lt;ref name=boeing2&gt;[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Boeing_Completes_Successful_Autonomous_Flight_Control_Technology_Program.html &quot;Boeing Completes Successful Autonomous Flight Control Technology Program&quot;, ''Space Daily'', March 20, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operators==
&lt;!-- no need to list --&gt;
The R-22 is operated by many private individuals, companies and flying clubs. In Australia, where there are 489 R22s registered as of mid-2011, a survey found that 62% of the fleet's flying time was in [[Muster (livestock)|mustering]] operations, while 13% of hours were spent in training pilots. Many broadcasters used the R-22 until the mid-1990s when the financial landscape of radio broadcasting in the U.S. changed due to deregulation of the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=July–August 2011 |title=Stockhorse of the sky: the Robinson R22 |journal= Flight Safety Australia |issue= 81 |pages=14–15 |publisher=[[Civil Aviation Safety Authority]] |editor1-first=Margo |editor1-last=Marchbank |issn=1325-5002 |accessdate=7 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accidents and incidents==
Since the R22 received FAA certification in March 1979, Robinson has delivered 4620 R22 helicopters. The R22 had 182 fatal accidents between March 1979 and June 2010 from a total of 1230 incidents. In late 1981, the R22 had its type certificate temporarily revoked by the Federal Aviation Administration due to delamination of a main rotor blade. The cause of the delamination was determined to be contamination of one of the bonded parts during a priming operation performed at an outside vendor. In response, Robinson Helicopter Company instituted stringent quality procedures and requirements, and replaced all main rotor blades on the fleet of 33 helicopters in service at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Krauss, Barbara. (1986, July/August). ''Robinson Helicopter: Number two and trying harder. Vertiflite, Volume 32'', p 24&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, the R22 experienced a number of student-pilot related accidents due the R22’s use as a primary flight trainer. Believing the number of accidents was the result of insufficient training and lax standards, Robinson established the Robinson Pilot Safety Course in 1982 to educate Certified Flight Instructors transitioning from larger helicopters to the new, smaller R22.&lt;ref&gt;Ells, Steven W. (2007, June 1) ''The highest standards: Robinson Helicopter aims for excellence. AOPA Pilot''.&lt;/ref&gt; After the introduction of the Robinson Pilot Safety Course, the rate of fatal R22 accidents declined from 3.7 per 100,000 flight hours in 1983 to 0.97 per 100,000 flight hours for the 12 months preceding July 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, J.R. &quot;Zoom&quot;. (1995, October) Witch hunt extraordinaire. ''US Aviator'' 8-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson’s statistics show the rate of fatal R22 accidents per 100,000 flight hours fell from 6.0 in 1982 to 0.7 in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson Helicopter Company. (2012, Spring). ''Robinson safety class turns thirty. Robinson News, Volume 18, Issue 1'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; To date more than 17,000 students have gone through the course.&lt;ref&gt;Moorman, Robert.

'''Thomas Russell Crampton''', [[Institution of Civil Engineers|MICE]], [[Institute of Mechanical Engineers|MIMechE]] (6 August 1816 – 19 April 1888) was an English engineer born at [[Broadstairs]], [[Kent]], and trained on [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Brunel's]] [[Great Western Railway]].

He is best known for designing the [[Crampton locomotive]] but had many engineering interests including the [[electric telegraph]] and the [[Channel Tunnel]] for which he designed a boring machine. His locomotives had much better success in France, Germany and Italy than they did in the UK.

==Personal life==
Born to John and Mary Crampton of Prospect Cottage (in what is now Dickens Walk), Broadstairs, on 6 August 1816, Crampton was the son of a plumber and architect.&lt;ref name=Life/&gt; He was educated privately. Crampton married Louisa Martha Hall, who was a singer and a friend of [[Jenny Lind]], on 25 February 1841.&lt;ref name=Tree&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chapelhill.homeip.net/FamilyHistory/OurFamilyData/d0005/g0000593.htm#I07523| publisher = David Horton &amp; Kerry Raymond| title = Louisa Martha HALL| accessdate = 2008-03-22}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had 8 children, six boys and two girls. The eldest girl, Ada Sarah, died aged 4 on 16 February 1857.&lt;ref name=Twig&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chapelhill.homeip.net/FamilyHistory/OurFamilyData/d0003/g0000318.htm#I07530| publisher = David Horton &amp; Kerry Raymond| title = Ada Sarah CRAMPTON| accessdate = 2008-03-22}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Crampton gifted a stained glass window in St. Peter's church, Broadstairs in her memory. Their youngest daughter, Louisa, was to marry [[Sir Horace Rumbold, 8th Baronet|Sir Horace Rumbold]], the Ambassador to the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=Life/&gt;

He died at his home, 19 Ashley Place, [[Westminster]] on 19 April 1888 and was buried in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=Life/&gt;

==Career==
Crampton entered a career in engineering, initially with [[Marc Brunel]] at the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR) in [[Swindon]].&lt;ref name=Life&gt;{{cite web | url = http://web.archive.org/web/20121120211033/http://www.cramptontower.co.uk/broadstairs.htm | publisher = Crampton Tower Museum via archive.org| title = PRIVATE LIFE AND BROADSTAIRS| accessdate = 2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Index&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.steamindex.com/people/crampton.htm| publisher = Steam Index| title = Thomas Russell Crampton | accessdate = 2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Western Railway 1839-43===
On joining the GWR in 1839,&lt;ref name=Tower&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cramptontower.co.uk/about.htm| publisher = Crampton Tower Museum| title = LOCOMOTIVES| accessdate = 2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crampton worked as assistant to Marc Brunel and then [[Daniel Gooch]]. Crampton was involved in the design of the [[GWR Firefly Class|&quot;Firefly&quot; class]] of locomotives.&lt;ref name=Tower/&gt; Gooch's aim was to produce [[broad gauge]] locomotives that were better than those on the [[standard gauge]] lines, thus proving the broad gauge system was the better technically. Crampton, unbeknown to the GWR, had the idea of improving standard gauge locomotives so that they could match those of the broad gauge. Crampton soon left the GWR.&lt;ref name=Index/&gt; In 1843, he left the GWR.&lt;ref name=Tower/&gt;

===Development 1844-51===
[[File:1846Cramptonloco.jpg|thumb|1846 Crampton locomotive]]Crampton realised that the locomotives of the GWR were better than the standard gauge locomotives for a number of reasons. The broad gauge allowed a larger [[boiler]] diameter and higher [[centre of gravity]] for the same stability. Broad gauge also allowed a bigger [[Firebox (steam engine)|firebox]] and heating area. Larger [[driving wheel]]s gave a lower piston speed, which allowed a higher speed for the locomotive before exhaust problems occurred.&lt;ref name=Index/&gt;

In 1843, Crampton took out a [[patent]] for a new design of [[Crampton locomotive|locomotive]]. It is for the physical appearance of his locomotives that Crampton is remembered for today, with the driving wheel placed behind the firebox. But there were technical improvements that he made, which laid the foundations for future locomotive design. The three most important improvements were:- wide steam passages, large heating surfaces and generous bearing surfaces on the wheels.&lt;ref name=Index/&gt;

From 1844 to 1848, Crampton was working for [[John Rennie the Younger|John]] and [[George Rennie (engineer)|George]] Rennie.

In 1845, Crampton received his first order for a locomotive built to his patent. 
The [[Namur (city)|Namur]] and [[Liège (city)|Liege]] Railway in Belgium ordered three locomotives with {{convert|7|ft|m|2}} diameter driving wheels and a {{convert|14.5|sqft|m2}} grate. They were built by the firm of [[Tulk and Ley]] of Whitehaven. One of the locomotives was tested in 1847 on the [[London and North Western Railway]], who then built a &quot;Crampton Patent&quot; locomotive at [[Crewe]]. Another two locomotives were bought by the LNWR, including a [[6-2-0]] ''Liverpool'' built by [[Bury, Curtis, and Kennedy]] in 1848 with {{convert|8|ft|m|2}} diameter driving wheels. A claim of {{convert|79|mph|km/h}} being achieved was made, with an average of {{convert|53|mph|km/h}} over {{convert|30|mi|km}} with a 60 ton load.&lt;ref name=Index/&gt; Another claim was for a speed of hauling eight carriages over {{convert|16|mi|km}} at an average speed of {{convert|74|mph|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=Italy&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.webalice.it/alberto.pezzoli81/treni/Storia/CramptonEngerth.htm| publisher = webalice.it| title = La locomotiva dell'impresa: la Crampton| accessdate = 2008-03-22}}{{it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One locomotive Crampton designed had an indirect drive arrangement, with a crankshaft between the driving wheels. This locomotive had a [[2-2+2-2]] wheel arrangement.&lt;ref name=Index/&gt; In 1847, Crampton became a founder member of the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]], and in 1848, Crampton set up in business as a Civil Engineer in London.&lt;ref name=Tower/&gt; In 1850, a Crampton locomotive was exhibited at [[Birmingham]] which had balance weights on the driving wheels. This feature was commented upon by [[William Stroudley]].&lt;ref name=Index/&gt; In 1851, Crampton started the Broadstairs Gasworks, overseeing the construction  and financing much of the works.&lt;ref name=Life/&gt;

===South Eastern Railway 1851-88===
[[File:Great Exhibition, No 136 Folkstone by HF Talbot, 1851.jpg|thumb|right|No. 136 ''Folkstone'' at [[The Great Exhibition]], 1851]]
[[File:Crampton tower.jpg|thumb|Crampton's water tower, Broadstairs]]By 1851, Crampton was working for the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]] (SER). In that year, ten new [[Crampton locomotive]]s were built, and one of these, No.136 ''Folkstone'' was exhibited at [[The Great Exhibition]].&lt;ref name=Percy&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.percywhitlock.org.uk/trains.htm| publisher = The Percy Whitlock Trust| title = The South Eastern and Chatham Railway and the London, Chatham and Dover Railway Amalgamated 1899 LOCOMOTIVES: Their Description, History, distinctive features and interest| accessdate = 2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854, Crampton became a member of the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] and in 1855 he was responsible for the building of the Berlin waterworks.&lt;ref name=Science&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10322977| publisher = The Science Museum| title = Thomas Russell Crampton, English engineer, c 1860s.| accessdate = 2008-03-22}} (a photo of Crampton is here)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1856, Crampton was appointed to the [[Prussia]]n [[Order of the Red Eagle]].&lt;ref name=Tower/&gt; In 1859, Crampton formed the Broadstairs Water Company, building a water tower {{convert|80|ft|m|2}} high which now forms the Crampton Tower Museum. The water tower could hold {{convert|83000|impgal|l}} of water. Broadstairs Water Company was taken over by Broadstairs Urban District Council in 1901. In 1860, Crampton designed a tower for Holy Trinity church, Broadstairs, which [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] had described as a &quot;hideous temple of flint, a petrified haystack&quot;. Crampton donated a clock as a personal gift to the church. he also donated a [[wrought iron]] bridge which was built across Goodson Steps. This is the Louisa Gap bridge, named after his youngest daughter.&lt;ref name=Life/&gt; Crampton was elected Vice-President of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1883.&lt;ref name=Tower/&gt;

===Peto, Betts and Crampton===
Crampton entered a partnersip with [[Peto and Betts|Sir Morton Peto and Edward Betts]] to  undertake part of the construction of the [[London Chatham and Dover Railway]]. When the partnership became insolvent in 1867, Crampton was made personally bankrupt,&lt;ref&gt;''The Morning Post'', 23 July 1868.&lt;/ref&gt; but, unlike Peto and Betts, managed to retain his good reputation and continue in business.

===Railway lines constructed===
Crampton was, wholly or partly, responsible for the railway lines built between [[Smyrna]] and [[Aidin]]; [[Varna]] and [[Rustchuk]]; [[Chatham Main Line|Strood and Dover]]; [[Maidstone East Line|Sevenoaks and Swanley]]; and [[Chatham Main Line|Herne Bay and Faversham]]. The latter three lines being built by the [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway]] (LCDR).&lt;ref name=Tower/&gt; Crampton was also the contractor, and later chairman of the [[East and West Junction Railway]]. A Crampton locomotive was used to haul the first train from [[Kineton]] to [[Fenny Compton]].&lt;ref name=EWJR&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.andythompson.net/history.htm| publisher = Andy Thompson| title = History of the line| accessdate = 2008-03-22 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080607170113/http://www.andythompson.net/history.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crampton was a partner in the [[Mont Cenis Pass Railway]]&lt;ref name=Ransom&gt;P. J. G. Ransom (1999), ''The Mont Cenis Fell Railway'', pp 30-32, [[Truro]]: [[Twelveheads Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electric telegraph===
Crampton was responsible for the laying of the first international submarine cable in the world. This was laid in the [[Strait of Dover]] in 1851.&lt;ref name=Index/&gt; The first messages were carried on 13 November 1851 and the cable was in use until 1859.&lt;ref name=Tower/&gt;

The company behind the project was an Anglo-French undertaking, known as ''la Compagnie du télégraphe sous-marin'' in France and the ''Submarine Telegraph Company between France and England'' in Great Britain. Crampton was the engineer, and [[Charlton Wollaston]] was the electrician involved in laying the cable across the Channel. The [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|SER]] were another early user of the electric telegraph, and it was by use of the SERs wires that messages were able to be transmitted between Paris and London, being relayed from [[Dover]].&lt;ref name=wire&gt;{{cite web | url = http://distantwriting.co.uk/competitorsallies.aspx| publisher = Distant Writing| title = COMPETITORS AND ALLIES| accessdate = 2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gandhisonia05052007.jpg|thumb|UPA chairperson [[Sonia Gandhi]].]]
The '''United Progressive Alliance''' ('''UPA''') is a [[Coalition government|coalition]] of left political parties in India formed after the [[Indian general election, 2004|2004 general election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://electionaffairs.com/parties/UPA.html United Progressive Alliance, UPA, UPA Performance General Election 2009, UPA Tally, UPA in Lok Sabha Elections 2009, India Elections 2009, General Elections, Election Manifest...&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the UPA is [[Indian National Congress]], whose president [[Sonia Gandhi]] is also the chairperson of the UPA. Subsequently the [[Prime Minister of India]], [[Manmohan Singh]], and the [[Council of Ministers of the Republic of India|Council of Ministers]] are drawn from members of the UPA.

==History==

The UPA was formed soon after the [[Indian general election, 2004|2004 general elections]] when it had become clear that no party had won an absolute majority. The hitherto ruling [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]-led [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] (NDA) had won 169 seats&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2008/07/12/stories/2008071260391200.htm Small parties, independents in great demand].&lt;/ref&gt; in the 543-member [[14th Lok Sabha]], as opposed the UPA's tally of 222 seats.

The [[Left Front (India)|Left Front]] with 59 MPs (excluding the [[speaker of the Lok Sabha]]), the [[Samajwadi Party]] with 39 MPs and the [[Bahujan Samaj Party]] with 19 MPs were other significant blocks that opted to support UPA at various phases of its rule.&lt;ref&gt;Originally the SP had [http://164.100.47.134/newls/membershomepage.aspx 39 MPs]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}. [http://www.rediff.com/news/2008/jul/25upavote1.htm 6 MPs defied party whip] and have been expelled from the party.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://164.100.47.134/newls/membershomepage.aspx Lok Sabha members]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UPA did not enjoy a simple majority on its own in the parliament, rather it has relied on the external support to ensure that it enjoys the confidence of the Indian parliament similar to the formula adopted by the previous minority governments of the [[United Front (India)|United Front]], the NDA, the Congress government of [[P. V. Narasimha Rao]], and earlier governments of [[V. P. Singh]] and [[Chandra Shekhar]].

An informal alliance had existed prior to the elections as several of the current constituent parties had developed seat-sharing agreements in many states. However, it was only after the election that the results of negotiations between parties were announced. The UPA government's policies were initially guided by a [[common minimum programme]] that the alliance hammered out with fruitful consultations with [[Jyoti Basu]] and [[Harkishan Singh Surjeet]] of the 59-member Left Front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Congress_pins_hopes_on_Jyoti_Basu/articleshow/3228282.cms | work=The Times of India | title=Congress pins hopes on Jyoti Basu | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=February 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, government policies were generally perceived as centre-left, reflecting the [[Centrism|centrist]] policies of the INC. The congress party is today more closely aligned with the [[neoliberalism]], strongly advocates [[social democracy]] and [[social liberalism]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

During the tenure of [[Jharkhand]] Chief Minister [[Madhu Koda]], the constituents of the UPA were, by mutual consent, supporting his government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/sep/14jhar5.htm Madhu Koda to be next Jharkhand CM]. Retrieved on 26 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

UPA survived a vote of confidence in the parliament on 22 July 2008 after left parties withdrew their support. Support from the Samajwadi Party was significant in this.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} In the Indian General Election in 2009, the UPA won 262 seats, of which the INC accounted for 206. Inclusive and populist policies along with a younger leadership has been credited for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/05/22/zakaria.indiaelections/ | work=CNN | title=Zakaria: Elections could mark India's debut as great power | accessdate=26 May 2010 | date=16 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial support==

Initially, UPA was given external support from the Left Front which totalled 59 MPs. Similar external support was also promised by several smaller parties that were not a member of any coalition, including the Samajwadi Party with 39 MPs, the [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] party with 4 MPs, the [[Janata Dal (Secular)]] with 3 MPs, and [[Bahujan Samaj Party]] with 19 MPs, who promised to support the government if it faced a [[vote of confidence]]. Nevertheless, these parties were not a part of the government. The UPA thus [[2004 election#May 13: India|had at least 335 MPs]] out of 543 supporting it at the time of its formation.

The Left parties, despite ideological differences with the Congress, supported the UPA to ensure a [[Secularism in India|secular government]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.rediff.com/election/2004/may/13basu.htm Secular govt a priority: Basu].&quot; Rediff Election Bureau 13 May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside support is currently being offered by the [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] Party (9 MPs), the [[Bharatiya Navshakti Party]] (1 MP), the [[Jammu &amp; Kashmir National Conference|National Conference]] (2 MPs)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20080058175 Inching closer to vote, govt safe@272] NDTV&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[National Loktantrik Party]] (1 MP). In addition, rebel MPs from [[Biju Janata Dal]], the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]], the [[Janata Dal (United)]], and the independent MPs take the tally of UPA supporting MPs to 275.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/FullcoverageStoryPage.aspx?sectionName=&amp;id=a78363f3-9f54-4f46-9da5-9fa0e4577ae8SinghisKing_Special&amp;MatchID1=4735&amp;TeamID1=8&amp;TeamID2=6&amp;MatchType1=1&amp;SeriesID1=1194&amp;PrimaryID=4735&amp;Headline=Abstentions+and+cross-voting...

====Left Front====

On 8 July 2008, [[Prakash Karat]], the general secretary of the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] (CPI (M)), announced that the Left Front would be withdrawing support over the decision by the government to go ahead with the [[Indo-US nuclear deal|Indo-U.S. nuclear deal]], a [[Section 123 Agreement]] with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Left-pulls-out-will-meet-President-Patil-on-Wednesday/332876/ Left pulls out, will meet President Patil on Wednesday]&lt;/ref&gt;

====People's Democratic Party====
On 4 January 2009, Mehbooba Mufti, president of the [[Jammu and Kashmir People's Democratic Party|People's Democratic Party]] announced the withdrawal of the PDP from the UPA given that the Congress had decided to support the [[Omar Abdullah]]-led [[Jammu &amp; Kashmir National Conference|National Conference]] Government in [[Jammu &amp; Kashmir]] after the [[Jammu and Kashmir state assembly elections, 2008|2008 state elections]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/pdp-withdraws-from-upa-unfortunate-says.../406523/ PDP withdraws from UPA], [[The Indian Express]]. 5 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pattali Makkal Katchi====

====All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen====
On 12 November 2012, Barrister [[Asaduddin Owaisi]], leader of the [[All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen|AIMIM]] announced the decision of the party's executive and declared that his party would now go after the state government for its &quot;communal&quot; and &quot;anti-people&quot; policies. Addressing a news conference, Owaisi said his party was compelled to take the decision due to &quot;the communal behaviour of [[Kiran Kumar Reddy]]'s government in [[Andhra Pradesh]]&quot;. Giving a detailed account of communal riots in the state and Hyderabad since 2010, he alleged that the Congress government not only turned a blind eye to MIM's demands to withdraw cases against innocent Muslims and take action against the guilty but pandered to the [[Sangh Parivar]]. The MIM's decision came after the government allegedly allowed construction of a canopy over a temple abutting the historic [[Charminar]] in alleged violation of court orders to maintain status quo. Owaisi criticised the chief minister for ignoring the high court order to maintain status quo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/majlis-e-ittehadul-muslimeen-withdraws-support-to-andhra-pradesh-government-and-upa/articleshow/17201214.cms Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen withdraws support to Andhra Pradesh government and UPA - Economic Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_mim-withdraws-support-to-upa-congress-in-andhra-pradesh_1763647 MIM withdraws support to UPA, Congress in Andhra Pradesh - India - DNA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jharkhand Vikas Morcha====

On 1 October 2012 the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha, led by Babulal Marandi, withdrew the support of its two MPs to the UPA government. The JVM was part of the UPA. Though this did not impact the stability of the government, the JVM's withdrawal of support came two weeks after a major UPA ally, the Trinamool Congress, pulled out of the alliance.

The reason for JVM's withdrawal was the same as the Trinamool's; against the decision to implement 51% FDI in Retail Businesses and the Hike in Diesel Prices.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

====Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam====
On 17 October 2012 14 DMK MPs, including central ministers [[T.R. Baalu]] and [[A.

Karunanithi's daughter Kanimozhi executed the 2G scandal with then Information Technology minister Andimuthu Raja and caused billions of rupees of loss to Government of India. During the investigation, they found a huge sum of money has been exchanged to DMK party leader Karunanithi's wives' TV channel. The UPA alliance, particularly Congress, has lost its confidence among the people of India due to several corruption charges.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

During the discussion for the vote of confidence,{{Which|date=January 2013}}{{When|date=January 2013}} BJP MPs produced cash in the parliament, as viewed on [[Lok Sabha TV]], alleging a bribe by the Samajwadi Party to vote for the government. The BJP claimed to have documentary evidence in a &quot;cash for vote&quot; scam and submitted a report before the parliamentary committee probing the matter.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The BJP also wrote a 17-page letter to the Parliamentary committee headed by Congress member V Kishore Chandradeo in this regard. [[Arun Jaitley]] said Samajwadi MP [[Reoti Raman Singh]] had offered his party's MPs the cash on the night of 21 July.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} He also alleged that SP leader [[Amar Singh (politician)|Amar Singh]] was behind the entire episode. Jaitley said: &quot;The investigating agencies did not do their job. So we inquired into the matter and gathered documentary evidence in the case.&quot; He alleged the 'cash for vote' scam reflected the subversion of the Indian Parliament, as well as a section of the media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/We-have-documentary-proof-of-cash-for-vote-scam-BJP/344093/ We have documentary proof of 'cash for vote' scam: BJP - Express India&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The winter session of parliament in October 2008 came under intense criticism from the Left parties and the BJP to demand a full fledged winter session instead of what was seen as the UPA to having &quot;scuttled the voice of Parliament&quot; by bringing down the sittings to a record low of 30 days in the year. The tensions between the UPA and the opposition parties became evident at an all-party meeting convened by [[Lok sabha speaker|Lok Sabha speaker]] [[Somnath Chatterjee]] when the leader of opposition, [[LK Advani]] questioned the status, timing and schedule of the current session of parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.financialexpress.com/news/Left-joins-BJP-to-sing-chorus-against-UPA/374896/ Left joins BJP to sing chorus against UPA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Karunanidhi had said he felt &quot;let down&quot; by the &quot;lukewarm&quot; response of the Centre and had demanded amendments in the resolution on Sri Lanka.

One of the amendments was to &quot;declare that [[genocide]] and [[war crime]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s had been committed and inflicted on the [[Eelam Tamils]] by the [[Sri Lankan Army]] and the administrators&quot;.

The second one was &quot;establishment of a credible and independent international commission of investigation in a time-bound manner into the allegations of war crimes, [[crimes against humanity]], violations of international [[human rights law]], violations of [[international humanitarian law]] and crime of genocide against the Tamils&quot;. Karunanidhi said Parliament should adopt the resolution incorporating these two amendments.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

The UPA has also been criticised for its alleged involvement in a number of scams such as the [[CWG scam|Commonwealth Games Scam]] of 2010, the [[2G scam]], and the [[Coalgate scam]].

'''USS ''Oklahoma City'' (SSN-723)''', a {{sclass|Los Angeles|submarine}}, is the second ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]]. The contract to build it was awarded to [[Northrop Grumman Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company]] in [[Newport News, Virginia]] on 13 August 1981 and its keel was laid down on 4 January 1984. It was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 2 November 1985 sponsored by Mrs. Linda M. Nickles, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 9 July 1988, with [[Commander]] Kevin John Reardon in command.

In 1991, ''Oklahoma City'' won the [[Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award]] for the Atlantic Fleet.

On 13 November 2002, ''Oklahoma City'' collided with the [[Leif Hoegh]] [[liquified natural gas]] tanker ''Norman Lady'', east of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]].  No one on either vessel was hurt, and there were no leaks of oil from fuel tanks and no threat to the environment, but the submarine sustained damage to its [[periscope]] and sail area, and put into [[La Maddalena]], Sardinia, for repairs. Its commanding officer, Commander Richard Voter, was relieved of his command on 30 November. One other officer and two enlisted crew members also were disciplined for alleged dereliction of duty.

On 20 January 2005 ''Oklahoma City'' returned to [[Norfolk, Virginia]], after a six-month deployment in support of national security interests and the [[War on Terrorism]].  ''OKC'' transited to its patrol area in the Pacific Ocean via the Arctic Ocean, the first such transit for a first-flight {{sclass|Los Angeles|submarine}}{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. After the patrol, it then completed a circumnavigation of North America by transiting back to the Atlantic Ocean through the [[Panama Canal]] and returning to its homeport in Norfolk.

In early 2007, ''Oklahoma City'' became the first submarine certified to exclusively use [[Digital Nautical Chart]]s (DNCs), using the [[Voyage Management System]] (VMS). VMS is part of the [[Electronic Chart Display and Information System-Navy]] (ECDIS-N) system, which has been under development since 1990. The shift from traditional paper navigation to an all-electronic navigation suite marked the first significant shift in U.S. Navy navigation practices since the introduction of the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) in the 1990s. 

From May to November 2007, ''Oklahoma City'' completed a deployment to the [[Persian Gulf]] in support of the [[War on Terror]]. It spent May to July 2008 in the Eastern Pacific in support of the [[War on Drugs]], and was responsible for seizing more than 11 [[metric ton]]s of [[cocaine]] valued at more than $1.5 billion (USD).

''Oklahoma City'' was awarded the 2008 Squadron Eight Battle &quot;E&quot;.  On 22 November 2008, Commander Aaron M. Thieme relieved Commander Louis Edward Mayer IV as [[Commanding Officer]].

After a 26-month overhaul, in March 2011 the sub was forward deployed to Guam.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews, Laura, &quot;[http://www.navytimes.com/news/2011/03/gannett-navy-oklahoma-city-arrives-at-guam-030311/ Sub Oklahoma City arrives at Navy Base Guam]&quot;, ''[[Military Times]]'', 3 March 2011, retrieved 4 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''USS ''Chicago'' (SSN-721)''' is a [[Los Angeles class submarine|''Los Angeles''-class]] [[submarine]], the fourth ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for the city of [[Chicago, Illinois]]. The contract to build her was awarded to [[Northrop Grumman Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company]] in [[Newport News, Virginia]] on 13 August 1981 and her keel was laid down on 5 January 1983.  She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 13 October 1984 sponsored by Mrs. Vicki Ann Paisley, wife of [[Melvyn R. Paisley]] assistant [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]], and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 27 September 1986, with Commander Robert Avery in command.

==Ship's History==
Early in 1996, an [[RQ-1 Predator]] aerial reconnaissance drone was successfully controlled from ''Chicago''. The drone reached altitudes up to 6000 meters (20,000&amp;nbsp;ft) and ranged up to 185 kilometers (100 [[nautical mile|nmi.]]) from the submarine, which was operating at periscope depth.

In the summer of 2005, ''Chicago'' tested the [[Virtual Periscope]], a system that would allow submerged submarines to observe the surface above them without having to come to a shallower depth, as is required by traditional [[periscope]]s.  A small camera mounted on the sail of the submarine uses the surface of the ocean as a [[lens (optics)|lens]], collecting light from above the surface and refracting it below. High-speed signal processing software assembles an image of what is on the surface. The system's resolution does not allow ship identification, only indicating that something is on the surface. Objects 30 meters (100&amp;nbsp;feet) tall can be seen at about a distance of 1600 meters (one mile). Sufficient light is available when a camera is shallower than 30 to 60 meters (100 to 200 feet).

On 15 March 2010 the sub's Captain, Commander Jeff Cima, was relieved of command after facing an [[nonjudicial punishment|Admirals's Mast]].  The mast found that Cima had been drunk and had acted in an &quot;unbecoming&quot; manner during a visit with NROTC midshipmen at [[Cornell University]] on 10 March 2010.  Cima was temporarily replaced by Captain James Horten.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

After completing a two-year maintenance and upgrade period at [[Pearl Harbor]] Naval Shipyard in October 2011, ''Chicago'' arrived in April 2012 at her new homeport, assigned to [[Submarine Squadron 15]], based at [[Joint Region Marianas]] on the island of [[Guam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guam Welcomes USS Chicago|url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=66766|publisher=United States Navy|accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current commanding officer of the USS Chicago is CDR Lance Thompson.

==Awards==

The USS ''Chicago'' has earned multiple awards in its service life. Chicago has been awarded many unit awards, including the [[Navy Unit Commendation]], three [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]]s and four [[Navy &quot;E&quot; Ribbon]] Submarine Squadron Battle 'E's.

Further, the ''Chicago'' has been awarded several campaign and service awards, including the [[Navy Expeditionary Medal]], [[National Defense Medal]], [[Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal]], two [[Southwest Asia Service Medal]]s, three [[Sea Service Ribbon]]s, [[Kuwait Liberation Medal (Saudi Arabia)]],and the [[Kuwait Liberation Medal (Kuwait)]]

Further, one of the barracks buildings at [[Recruit Training Command]] is named after the ''Chicago''.

==In Fiction==

USS ''Chicago'' plays a prominent role in [[Tom Clancy]]'s novel ''[[Red Storm Rising]]''.

USS ''Chicago'' is seen deploying elements of Task Force 141 in the ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]'' mission &quot;The Only Easy Day... Was Yesterday&quot;.

'''USS ''Key West'' (SSN-722)''', a [[Los Angeles class submarine|''Los Angeles''-class submarine]], was the third ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for [[Key West, Florida]]. The contract to build her was awarded to [[Northrop Grumman Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company]] in [[Newport News, Virginia]] on 13 August 1981 and her keel was laid down on 6 July 1983.  She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 20 July 1985 sponsored by Mrs. Virginia Conn, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 12 September 1987 with Commander Warren Lipscomb, Jr. in command.  She is the fourth [[Los Angeles class submarine|''Los Angeles'' - class submarine]] equipped with the vertical launch system (VLS) capable of carrying 12 Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles ([[TLAM]]).

USS ''Key West'' was home ported at the [[Norfolk Naval Base]], [[Norfolk, VA]]. She operated out of Norfolk, VA until 1995. During her [[United States Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic Fleet]] service, she completed numerous [[Cold War]] deployments and supported operations in the Caribbean, Western Atlantic and Mediterranean. USS ''Key West'' was awarded the &quot;Hook-em&quot; antisubmarine warfare (ASW) excellence award following her 1990 Mediterranean Cruise. She later was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation Award for her superior performance in Cold War operations during the 1989 and 1990 deployments. USS ''Key West'' won the &quot;TOP TORP&quot; Torpedo Shooting Competition in 1992 and was later awarded the Submarine Squadron Eight [[Battle E|Battle &quot;E&quot;]] for that year.

The USS ''Key West'' deployed with the [[USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71)|''Theodore Roosevelt'']] Carrier Battle Group in 1995. During that deployment she operated in the Mediterranean Sea and Persian Gulf and was awarded the [[Navy Unit Commendation]], [[Armed Forces Service Medal|Armed Forces Service]], and [[NATO Medal|NATO Service]] medals. Following the 1995 deployment, USS ''Key West'' underwent an availability in Norfolk, VA in preparation for her transfer to the [[United States Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] in 1996. She departed Norfolk in June 1996 and transited the [[Panama Canal]] as part of her transfer to the Pacific Fleet. She arrived in [[Pearl Harbor, Hawaii]] in July 1996 and began operations under Submarine Squadron One.

The USS ''Key West'' visited her name sake city in 1987 for a week long celebration after commissioning, in 1992 and later in 1994. Since reassignment to the Pacific Fleet she has not been able to visit [[Key West, Florida]] again.

In April 1997, USS ''Key West'' conducted her first Pacific deployment with the [[USS Constellation (CV-64)|''Constellation'']] Carrier Battle Group. During this deployment, she operated in the [[Pacific Ocean]], [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Persian Gulf]]. Later that year, USS ''Key West'' was reassigned to Submarine Squadron Three. In the next year, she deployed to the Eastern Pacific in support of the [[USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70)|''Carl Vinson'']] and [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|''Abraham Lincoln'']] Carrier Battle Groups, and later supported the 1998 Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise.

From 1998 through 2001 she supported Pacific theater operations in both the [[United States Third Fleet|Third Fleet]] and [[United States Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]] area of operations. During this time she participated in numerous bilateral and multilateral exercises with our Pacific Theater partner. Following the [[11 September attacks]], she was redirected Bahrain to the Northern Arabian Sea where she launched Tomahawk Land Attack Cruise Missiles against Afghanistan in October 2001.&lt;ref&gt;SSN 722 at [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/ssn-722.htm Global Security]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; USS ''Key West'' conducted deployments to the Western Pacific in support of Seventh Fleet operations.

In 2007 USS ''Key West'' was named &quot;Battle E&quot; for COMSUBRON THREE, given to the best submarine in its squadron, awarded the Arleigh Burke Trophy for the most improved sea command in the Pacific, and awarded the Naval Unit Commendation for its outstanding accomplishments during the deployment.

In 2009 USS ''Key West'' was again awarded the &quot;Battle E&quot; award for COMSUBRON Three for outstanding performance during the 2009 WESTPAC deployment.

In 2012 USS ''Key West'' shifted home port to Naval Base Guam to support Seventh Fleet operations as a forward deployed unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Price|first=Jeffrey|title=USS Key West Arrives in Guam|url=http://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=70626|publisher=United States Navy|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Command Emblem==
[[Image:722insig.png|right|150px]]
The [[conch]] shell is the focal point of the submarine's emblem for the fabled horn of the Greek God [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] and the symbol of the submarine's namesake city. The USS ''Key West'' is emerging from the shell which symbolizes the emergence of the city as the leading city of the Florida Keys.

The submarine insignia symbolizes the heritage that the ship has with all past and future submarines.  The motto &quot;Liberate Clavis Tenacitas et Ingenium&quot; translates to &quot;The Key to Freedom is Tenacity and Resourcefulness.&quot;  Specifically, the phrase &quot;The Key to Freedom&quot; represents the namesake city and the submarine's mission to protect the fundamental rights and liberties of the American people.&lt;ref&gt;Symbolism of the USS Key West Crest.  [http://www.ssn722.navy.mil/sub.htm USS Key West Information] FT1/SS Glenn W. Kemmerer&lt;/ref&gt;  The phrase &quot;Tenacity and Resourcefulness&quot; was used by the Mayor of Key West during his speech at the ship's launching to describe the characteristics of a true Conch &amp;mdash;a native of Key West. Additionally, &quot;Ingenium&quot; is a word used by the ancient Greek and Roman historians to describe the resourcefulness and ingenuity of sailors in the period.&lt;ref&gt;

==In popular fiction==
In the [[Tom Clancy]] novel ''[[Red Storm Rising]]'', ''Key West'' participated in a [[cruise missile]] strike against the [[Soviet Union]].

In the  novel ''Kirov III-Pacific Storm'' by John Schettler, ''Key West'' is involved in a critical action with the Russian Battlecruiser Kirov II.

In the Swedish novel ''Landsförrädaren'' by [[Anders Jallai]], the ''Key West'' makes an appearance to save the [[protagonist]].

'''USS ''Newport News'' (SSN-750)''', a {{sclass|Los Angeles|submarine}}, was the third ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for [[Newport News, Virginia]].

==Construction==
The contract to build her was awarded to [[Northrop Grumman Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company]] in [[Newport News, Virginia]] on 19 April 1982 and her keel was laid down on 3 March 1984.  She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 15 March 1986 sponsored by [[Paul S. Trible, Jr.|Mrs. Rosemary D. Trible]], and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 3 June 1989 with Commander Mark B. Keef in command. Mayor [[Jessie M. Rattley]] presented the ship with a commemorative plaque containing the poem &quot;Newport News,&quot; written by Newport News native Ronald W. Bell, whose poem &quot;[[Hyman G. Rickover|Admiral Rickover]]&quot; also appears upon a plaque aboard the ''Los Angeles'' class submarine {{USS|Hyman G. Rickover|SSN-709|2}}.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The poem appears on this page with permission from the author:{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}
::&quot;Newport News&quot;
:Harbor of a thousand ships
:Forger of a nation's fleet
:Gateway to the New World
:Where ocean and river meet
:Strength wrought from steel
:And a people's fortitude
:Such is the timeless legacy
:Of a place called Newport News.

==Initial operations==
''Newport News'' returned to [[Norfolk, Virginia]], following a six-month overseas deployment that included operations in the Middle East. In support of Operation Iraqi Freedom she launched 19 UGM-109C Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles in March 2003.  She deployed in August 2004, first to take part in joint operations with allied navies in the North Atlantic, then to the U.S. Central Command area of operations &quot;in support of national security interests and the global war on terrorism.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Collision with Japanese ship==
On 8 January 2007, ''Newport News'' was operating submerged in the [[Arabian Sea]] south of the [[Straits of Hormuz]] when it hit the Japanese tanker ''Mogamigawa''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/01/08/japan.us.ship/index.html U.S. sub collides with Japan ship], CNN, 8 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; She had been operating as part of Carrier Strike Group 8 (CSG-8),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=24919 Eisenhower Strike Group Completes JTFEX 06-2]&lt;/ref&gt; organized around the [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|Dwight D. Eisenhower|CVN-69|3}}. The Carrier Strike Group was redeploying to the Indian Ocean to support a maritime cordon during the [[War in Somalia (2006–2009)|war in Somalia]] when the incident happened.&lt;ref name=US-STRIKE-IN-SOMALIA-TARGETS-AL-QAEDA-FIGURE&gt;{{cite news

Newport News was escorted from the mouth of the Straits of Hormuz to Bahrain by the [[Guided Missile Destroyer]] [[USS Benfold (DDG-65)]]. This was due to the fact that the submarine was unable to transit submerged and has no surface defense capabilities. During the transit, Iranian aircraft and warships shadowed the ships.
An official of the Kawasaki Kisen Company (or [[K Line]]), which owns the tanker, announced that
''Mogamigawa''{{'}}s hull and propellers were damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|date=11 January 2007
|publisher=[[ITAR-TASS]]
|accessdate=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a Navy spokesman, the collision occurred as a result of the [[venturi effect]].  The tanker drove over the area where the submarine was submerged and this created a sucking effect that forced the submarine upward to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The incident was the third collision between a U.S. nuclear-powered submarine and a Japanese civilian ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kiroku Hanai|title=U.S. presence vs. the public will|publisher=[[The Japan Times]]|date=23 January 2007|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20070123kh.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 January, after the boat returned to Bahrain for repairs, administrative personnel actions ([[Admiral's Mast]]) were taken against several members of her crew, which included relieving the boat's commanding officer, Commander Matthew A. Weingart, of command due to a lack of confidence in his ability to command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On 10 April the Iranian [[Fars News Agency]] reported that the ''Newport News'' has been leaking radioactive and chemical pollution in the Persian Gulf and claimed that following this formal complaint, the ship departed the gulf for a complete overhaul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&quot;'''Obsession'''&quot; is a second season episode of the original [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' and was broadcast on December 15, 1967. It is episode #42, production #47, written by [[Art Wallace]], and directed by [[Ralph Senensky]].

In this episode, Captain [[James T. Kirk]] becomes [[fixation (psychology)|obsessed]] with destroying a deadly entity he once encountered in his youth.

This episode deals with several human emotions: guilt, fear, obsession and, ultimately, redemption. While Captain Kirk is the primary focus, the viewer sees glimpses of these emotions in other members of the ship. At various times the &quot;fight or flight&quot; instinct is shown as an internal battle which one has to overcome in order to find emotional peace.

==Plot==
The [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] [[starship]] USS ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Enterprise]]'' has sent down a landing team to a planet to search for tritanium deposits. While surveying, Captain Kirk notices a sweet honey smell, and has his men go on alert. He tells them to scan for dikironium and immediately fire at anything that looks like a gaseous cloud. The landing party fans out to explore.

One group picks up a signal but loses it, at which point they are immediately attacked. Kirk and Science Officer [[Spock]] rush over to the scene, finding three crewmen down; two dead, the other, Ensign Rizzo, near death. All of the men have had their [[red blood cell]]s drained of [[hemoglobin]]. Kirk fears that the killer is the same entity he had encountered 11 years before while serving aboard the USS ''Farragut''. As a young lieutenant, Kirk had hesitated in firing the ship's phasers at the creature, which promptly attacked. The encounter killed half the Farragut's crew, with Kirk and the ship's first officer among the survivors. Kirk felt great guilt over what happened even though, on the subsequent official record, the XO had praised the young Kirk for his actions in battle, describing Kirk as &quot;a fine young officer who performed with uncommon bravery.&quot;

The landing team quickly returns to the Enterprise. Once aboard, Kirk becomes obsessed with finding this entity, feeling guilty that it caused so much damage and then eluded him. He ignores his priority orders to rendezvous with the USS ''Yorktown'', to transfer urgent medical supplies destined for Theta VII, until Chief Medical Officer [[Leonard McCoy|Dr. McCoy]] can confirm the cause of the men's deaths. McCoy, however, is at a loss and complains that he doesn't even know where to begin. Kirk tells him to reference the Farragut's medical logs and start there. On the bridge, Kirk has Spock look for a gaseous entity that is able to conceal itself and pass through solid matter. Spock is intrigued about such a creature, fascinated that it can move through space and time at will. He suggests that it must be able to control its molecular structure, but Kirk cuts him off, stating he doesn't want a scientific analysis and just wants the creature found.

Kirk calls one of the security officers, Ensign Garrovick. to the bridge. The ensign's father was the commanding officer of the Farragut and lost his life to the entity. Kirk believes Garrovick's son will be as driven in finding the creature as he is and assigns him to the next landing party to hunt the entity down. As soon as they prepare to leave, Dr. McCoy reports that Rizzo has died of his injuries.

Kirk orders his landing party to fire at the entity as soon as it is spotted. He informs his men that the creature attacks quickly, so any hesitation will be deadly. The team spreads out and Ensign Garrovick soon encounters the creature. He aims his phaser but hesitates to fire, becoming frozen with fear as his partner is killed. The creature moves off just as Kirk arrives. Back on the ''Enterprise'', Garrovick admits that he hesitated before firing his [[phaser (Star Trek)|phaser]] and is confined to quarters.

McCoy has seen enough and confronts the Captain on his reckless obsession over the creature. He summons Spock to consider Kirk's fitness for command. Kirk justifies his actions by maintaining that the creature is an intelligent predator and a serious threat to inhabited worlds. He warns that if it manages to travel to a populated system, there is no telling how many it will kill. McCoy finally backs off as Ensign [[Pavel Chekov|Chekov]] reports that he is tracking the cloud creature moving away from the planet.

The landing party quickly returns to the ship and Kirk orders a pursuit of the cloud at [[Warp drive (Star Trek)|Warp 8]]. The ship gives chase, but Chief Engineer [[Montgomery Scott|Scott]] doubts the ''Enterprise'' can sustain the high speeds for long. Kirk orders a reduction of speed and, curiously, the entity slows down as well. It slows as if preparing for a confrontation and allowing them to catch up. Kirk orders battle stations as the entity cloud comes into range, and gives the order to fire their weapons. The phasers and photon torpedoes pass right through the being without incident. Not only do the weapons have no effect, but neither do the deflector shields - the creature passes right through the ship's hull and into the ventilation system. Kirk orders a shutdown of life support, limiting the crew to two hours of air. He orders Scotty to close all vents and flood the system with gas.

After a conference, Spock points out to Kirk that since the creature is immune to conventional weapons fire, he needn't blame himself for hesitating to fire in the earlier incident. Firing promptly on the creature would have made no difference, and the resulting deaths by the creature were impossible for Kirk to prevent.

Meanwhile, the creature exits the vents and kills two crewmen. It then enters the room of Ensign Garrovick and tries to attack him, but Spock was already present shortly before the it arrived. The creature gets a sample of Spock's [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] blood, which repels it due to its alien composition. The creature quickly lets Spock go and flees the ship. Dr. McCoy wryly comments that Spock's green blood &quot;must have left a bad taste.&quot;

The creature makes its way to the fourth planet in the Tycho system and the ''Enterprise'' heads there in pursuit. Kirk wonders if the planet is the creature's natural home, since that is where the ''Farragut'' originally encountered it. Kirk plans a trap for the creature while Spock comments that the creature may be feeding in order to reproduce. If the entity is not stopped they could be facing more of them.

Kirk and Ensign Garrovick beam down to the planet with a case that holds an [[antimatter]] bomb. The two lure the creature with blood from the ship's medical supply, but it quickly gobbles up the &quot;bait&quot; before they can lead it to the bomb.

Kirk decides to use himself as bait and remain behind to detonate the bomb. He orders Garrovick back to the ship, but the young officer refuses to abandon his Captain and a fight ensues before Kirk can explain that he does not mean to sacrifice himself. The two ready the bomb as the creature draws near. With the creature ready to envelop them, Kirk and Garrovick beam away and the antimatter bomb explodes, annihilating the entity and much of Tycho IV with it.

Once safe aboard the ship, Kirk takes Garrovick aside to thank him and tell him a few stories about his father, Captain Garrovick.

[[File:Badische IX.jpg|thumb|300px|German Crampton locomotive &quot;Badenia&quot;]]A '''Crampton locomotive''' is a type of [[steam locomotive]] designed by [[Thomas Russell Crampton]] and built by various firms from [[1846 in rail transport|1846]].  The main British builders were [[Tulk and Ley]] and [[Robert Stephenson and Company]].

Notable features were a low [[boiler]] and large [[driving wheels]]. The crux of the Crampton patent was that the single driving axle was placed behind the firebox, so that the driving wheels could be very large. This helped to give this design a low centre of gravity, so that it did not require a very [[broad-gauge]] track to travel safely at high speeds.  Its [[wheel arrangement]] was usually [[4-2-0]] or [[6-2-0]].

==Design variations==

Because the single driving axle was behind the firebox, Crampton locomotives usually had outside cylinders.  However, some inside cylinder versions were built using indirect drive, then known as a ''jackshaft''.  The inside cylinders drove a [[crankshaft]] located in front of the firebox and the crankshaft was connected to the driving wheels by outside rods.  Some long-wheelbase [[0-4-0]] [[tank locomotive]]s were also built using this crankshaft system.  The boiler feed-pump was often driven from the crankshaft as well because many Cramptons were built before the [[injector]] was invented.

Another peculiarity on some Crampton locomotives was the use of a boiler of oval cross-section, to lower the centre of gravity.  It would nowadays be regarded as bad engineering practice because the internal pressure would tend to push the boiler into a circular cross-section and increase the risk of [[metal fatigue]].

==Usage==
[[File:France Paris Champs Elysees Locomotive Crampton 80 01.JPG|thumb|Preserved French Crampton locomotive]]
Crampton locomotives were used by some British railways and speeds of up to 120&amp;nbsp;km/h (75&amp;nbsp;mph) were achieved on the [[London and North Western Railway|LNWR]]. They were more popular in [[France]], southern [[Germany]] and the [[United States|US]]. In France the expression ''&quot;prendre la Crampton&quot;'' meant to catch an express. One of the French examples has been preserved in the ''[[Musée Français du Chemin de Fer|Cité du Train]]'' (the French Railway Museum) at [[Mulhouse]] and is still in working order. This is number 80 of the ''[[Chemin de Fer de l'Est]]'', the [[Paris]]-[[Strasbourg]] line, which is named ''&quot;Le Continent&quot;''.

==Locomotive list==

Approximate numbers of Crampton-type locomotives built in Europe were:
* Great Britain 51
* France 127
* Germany 135

Notes
# ''Namur'' was tested over {{convert|2300|mi|km}} on the [[LNWR]] &lt;ref name=LNWR&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.steamindex.com/locotype/lnwr.htm#j154| publisher = Steam Index| title = London &amp; North Western Railway locomotives: Introduction &amp; pre-Ramsbottom| accessdate = 2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; speeds up to {{convert|62|mph|km/h}} were recorded.  Delivery of ''Namur'', ''Liege'' and the third engine ordered for Belgium was delayed, and they were purchased by the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]] in December 1849, becoming SER Nos 81, 83 and 85. 
# The LNWR obtained two other Crampton-type locomotives: ''Courier'', 4-2-0, built at [[Crewe Works]] in 1847 and [[Liverpool (1848 Crampton locomotive)|''Liverpool'']], [[6-2-0]], built by [[Bury, Curtis, and Kennedy]] in 1848. 
# LNWR No.200 ''London'', larger boiler and cylinders than ''Namur''. Later rebuilt as an [[0-4-2]].&lt;ref name=LNWR/&gt;
# Dundee and Perth and Aberdeen Junction Railway, absorbed by the [[Scottish Central Railway]] in 1863

'''Built by:''' [[Robert Stephenson and Company]]
&lt;br /&gt;
Robert Stephenson and Company built a number of Crampton type locomotives for the [[South Eastern Railway (UK)|South Eastern Railway]] and the [[London, Chatham and Dover Railway]].  These were all of [[4-2-0]] wheel arrangement with inside cylinders and indirect drive.  The inside cylinders drove a [[crankshaft]] located in front of the firebox and the crankshaft was coupled to the driving wheels by outside rods.

'''USS ''Pasadena'' (SSN-752)''', a [[Los Angeles class submarine|''Los Angeles''-class submarine]], was the third ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for [[Pasadena, California]]. 

''Pasadena'' provides the Fleet Commander or Task Force Commander a multi-mission platform. This vessel has unlimited endurance due to the nuclear propulsion plant, advanced sonar, torpedo, cruise missile, and mine delivery systems, a combination of speed and stealth due to quieting and the capacity to fulfill numerous missions.

==History==
The contract to build her was awarded to the [[Electric Boat]] Division of [[General Dynamics]] Corporation in [[Groton, Connecticut]] on 30 November 1982 and her keel was laid down on 20 December 1985.  She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 12 September 1987 sponsored by Mrs. Pauline Trost, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 11 February 1989 with Commander W. Fritchman in command.

Originally assigned to Submarine Force, [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet]], ''Pasadena'' conducted an inter-fleet transfer in October 1990 to the Submarine Force, [[U.S. Pacific Fleet]], and was homeported in [[San Diego, California]].

In July 1991, ''Pasadena'' became the first Improved 688 Class submarine to deploy, commencing a six-month Western Pacific deployment. In June 1993, she commenced a six-month Western Pacific deployment to the Persian Gulf. While deployed, ''Pasadena'' participated in several exercises with the [[Royal Saudi Navy|Royal Saudi]], [[Royal Navy of Oman|Omani]] and [[Royal Australian Navy|Australian]] Navies, and was the first United States SSN to conduct exercises with the [[Indian Navy]] in [[Malabar 2007|MALABAR Naval Exercise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/2003/10/06/stories/2003100602700500.htm |title=Indo-U.S. naval exercise begins today |date=2003-10-06 | location=Chennai, India |work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She also became the first nuclear-powered submarine to visit the port of [[Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]] on the [[Red Sea]].

In March 1995, ''Pasadena'' again deployed on a six-month Western Pacific Deployment. While deployed to the [[Persian Gulf]] she became the first nuclear-powered submarine to visit the port of [[Muscat, Oman]]; the first to operate continuously inside the Persian Gulf; and the first SSN to be assigned to Commander, U.S. [[United States Fifth Fleet|Fifth Fleet]]. 

In April 1996, ''Pasadena'' changed homeports to [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Hawaii]] where she is now assigned to Commander, Submarine Squadron Seven. From June 1996 to September 1996, ''Pasadena'' underwent a Selected Restricted Availability (SRA) where she was outfitted with improved offensive and defensive weapon systems. In April 1997, ''Pasadena'' deployed to the Eastern Pacific for a four-month deployment in support of UNITAS.

 In September 2011, the sub entered [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]] for systems upgrades and maintenance work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]], &quot;[http://www.navytimes.com/news/2011/09/ap-navy-pasadena-submarine-arrives-at-portsmouth-092111/ Submarine Pasadena arrives at Portsmouth]&quot;, ''[[Military Times]]'', 21 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Wednesday, Sept. 21 2011 ''Pasadena'' and her crew of 18 officers and 126 enlisted personnel arrived at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Kittery, Maine. While at the Shipyard, Pasadena will complete various maintenance work and several system upgrades.
 
As of December 2013, her maintenance has been completed and she has returned to her homeport in San Diego. &lt;ref&gt;Editor's son was assigned to the Pasadena and is stationed there.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
''Pasadena'' was awarded the Submarine Squadron Seven Battle &quot;E&quot; Efficiency award for 1998, which recognizes commands that have attained the highest overall or departmental readiness to carry out their wartime tasks. She was awarded the Morale and Welfare Recreation (MWR) Fleet Recreation award for the entire Navy in 2001.

==Insignia==
''Pasadena''’s insignia is surrounded by a mooring line border with blue background, emphasizing the nautical character of the seal. The surrounding banner carries the ship's hull number and name and bracketed by the motto.  The motto, in addition to enhancing the central combative caricature, states in clear terms the readiness of today’s force to fight anywhere in the world on short notice in the national interest.  The red rose ties the ship to the City of Pasadena, home of the New Year’s Day [[Tournament of Roses Parade]], which dates back more than 100 years. The turtle pugilist ties SSN-752 to [[USS Pasadena (CL-65)|''Pasadena'' (CL-65)]], a [[World War II]] light cruiser that earned six battle stars.  The emblem for CL-65 was created for the cruiser by [[Walt Disney]].  Interestingly, during the sub's construction at the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics in Groton, CT, the crew adopted a North American Snapping Turtle as a mascot.  The creature actually road the boat into the Thames river during its launching.  By the time construction was over, the turtle, named Frumpy, which originally fit into the palm of a hand, was over 18 inches long, forcing the crew to find a new home.  Cal Poly in Pasadena proved a willing host.  To get him to his new abode, two crew members:  ET1(SS) Del Laughery, and ET1(SS) Don Hilliker, both pilots, flew the turtle in a private aircraft from Groton to Pasadena.

== Popular culture ==
* ''Pasadena'' is featured in the anime, ''[[Full Metal Panic!]]''.
* ''Pasadena'' is the center of the 1990 novel ''Boomer''
* ''Pasadena'' is featured in the [[Tom Clancy]] novel ''[[Executive Orders]]'' as one of several fast-attack submarines tasked to keep an eye on the hostilities growing between [[The People's Republic of China]] and [[The Republic of China]] (Taiwan); The ROC has been called Taiwan since the 1970s but is referred to as the ROC many times in the novel. Pasadena is also featured in Tom Clancy's novel Debt of Honor.

'''USS ''Columbus'' (SSN-762)''', a {{sclass|Los Angeles|submarine}}, was the fourth ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for [[Columbus, Ohio]]. The contract to build her was awarded to the [[Electric Boat]] Division of [[General Dynamics]] Corporation in [[Groton, Connecticut]] on 21 March 1986 and her keel was laid down on 9 January 1991.  She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 1 August 1992 sponsored by Mrs. Margaret DeMars, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 24 July 1993 with Commander Carl M. Smeigh, Jr. in command.

==Operational history==
''Columbus'' completed a Post Shipyard Availability in June 1994 in Groton, Connecticut after initial construction and shakedown operations. In September 1994, the ship conducted an interfleet transfer to [[Pearl Harbor]], [[Hawaii]] and joined the U.S. Pacific Fleet Submarine Force. ''Columbus'' deployed to the [[Pacific Ocean|Western Pacific]] in late 1995 through early 1996 and conducted a variety of operations as a unit of the [[United States Seventh Fleet|U.S. 7th Fleet]] along the way making port visits in Hong Kong, Subic Bay, Guam, and Yokosuka, Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/shiphist/c/ssn-762/1996.pdf Command history. USS COLUMBUS (SSN 762)], Department of the Navy, 7 Mar 97&lt;/ref&gt;

''Columbus'' was the first Submarine equipped with the BYG-1 Fire Control System in December 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/shiphist/c/ssn-762/2002.pdf Ship's history. USS COLUMBUS (SSN 762)], Department of the Navy, 12 Sep 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Two successful test launches of Tactical Tomahawk (Block IV) cruise missiles were conducted in late May 2003 from USS ''Columbus'' (SSN 762), underway in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schroeder |first=Sandra |url=http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=7644 |title=Submarine USS Columbus Launches Tomahawks in West Coast Tests |publisher=Navy.mil |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus departed Pearl Harbor for another western Pacific deployment in late 2003  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Journalist |first=Chief |url=http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=10297 |title=USS Columbus Deploys to Western Pacific |publisher=Navy.mil |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and visited Chinhae, South Korea, Singapore, and Japan while taking part in Annual-Ex 2003(exercise) with various units of the Japanese Navy Defense force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/shiphist/c/ssn-762/2004.pdf Command history. USS COLUMBUS (SSN 762)], Department of the Navy, 1 Apr 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a modernization refit at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in Bremerton Washington the ''Columbus'' returned to Submarine Squadron Seven in Pearl Harbor and departed Pearl Harbor in March 2008 for a regularly scheduled six-month deployment. Deployed with the Seventh Fleet, ''Columbus'' supported national taskings and theater security cooperation efforts while making port visits in Saipan, Guam, Okinawa, Sasebo, and Yokosuka, Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Communication |first=Mass |url=http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=39699 |title=USS Columbus Returns to Pearl Harbor |publisher=Navy.mil |date=13 September 2008 |accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In January 2009 ''Columbus'' won the Submarine Squadron 7 Battle Efficiency (Battle &quot;E&quot;) award, given to the submarine crew that best demonstrates technical proficiency and continual mission readiness throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csp.navy.mil/archived_news/Jan09/release_09002.shtml |title=Commander, Submarine Force U.S. Pacific Fleet &amp;#124; Official Military Website |publisher=Csp.navy.mil |date=14 October 2003 |accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; CDR David Minyard relieved CDR Doody as Commanding Officer on 8 May 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csp.navy.mil/releases/release_09029.shtml |title=Commander, Submarine Force U.S. Pacific Fleet &amp;#124; Official Military Website |publisher=Csp.navy.mil |date=14 October 2003 |accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009, the Chief of Naval Operations announced that the ship was the Pacific Fleet winner of the Calendar Year 2008 Arleigh Burke Fleet Trophy.&lt;ref name=&quot;npc.navy.mil&quot;&gt;[http://www.npc.navy.mil/NR/rdonlyres/68C557A1-E67A-4210-8AAF-D13D1968DC9E/0/NAV09206.txt CALENDAR YEAR 2008 ARLEIGH BURKE FLEET TROPHY AWARD RECIPIENTS], ADMIRAL G. ROUGHEAD, CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS&lt;/ref&gt;

The Columbus returned to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii in August 2012 after completing a six-month deployment that included 7th fleet and national mission taskings along with port visits to Japan, South Korea, and Guam while under the command  of Cmdr. David Youtt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hookelenews.com/uss-columbus-completes-western-pacific-deployment/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''USS ''Toledo'' (SSN-769)''', a {{sclass|Los Angeles|submarine}}, was the third ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for [[Toledo, Ohio]]. The contract to build her was awarded to [[Northrop Grumman Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company]] in [[Newport News, Virginia]] on 10 June 1988 and her keel was laid down on 6 May 1991.  She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 28 August 1993 sponsored by Mrs. Sabra Smith, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 24 February 1995, with Commander Jack Loye III in command. The submarine was a cover story of the 6 April 1998 issue ''[[US News &amp; World Report]]''.

==Deployments==
The USS ''Toledo'' returned to the [[Naval Submarine Base New London]] in mid-April 2003 after having taken part in [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]].

On 7 December 2004, ''Toledo'' returned to [[Groton, Connecticut]], after a six-month deployment in the [[Persian Gulf]] with the {{USS|John F. Kennedy|CV-67|2}} [[carrier strike group]] that included port calls in [[Crete]], [[Dubai]], and Bahrain. Her route home from Bahrain was unusual, rounding the [[Cape of Good Hope]] rather than using the [[Suez Canal]]. Once back in the North Atlantic, she was diverted for a classified drug interdiction mission with the [[Joint Interagency Task Force]]&amp;ndash;South in the [[Caribbean Sea]].

On 31 January 2006, ''Toledo'' again departed for a six-month deployment to CENTCOM. Port calls included [[Augusta Bay, Sicily|Augusta Bay]], [[Dubai]], the British island territory of [[Diego Garcia]] and [[La Maddalena]]. The ship returned from this deployment on 31 July 2006 and a change of command ceremony took place in 2009 where Commander Reckamp relieved Commander Goldman.

''Toledo'' left for another six-month deployment on 23 July 2010.

In December 2010 ''Toledo'' did a port call in [[Haifa]]. Commander Reckamp was received by the Haifa City Major [[Yona Yahav]] in the City Hall as is customary for visiting commanders of warships doing port calls in Haifa.

On 20 January 2011, ''Toledo'' returned to [[Groton, Connecticut]] after a six-month deployment that included port calls in Cyprus, Bahrain, and [[Haifa]].

==Maintenance==
[[Northrop Grumman]] Corporation was awarded a contract from the U.S. Navy for maintenance work, known as a depot modernization period, on the nuclear-powered submarine USS ''Toledo'' (SSN 769). The initial planning contract was valued at approximately $34.7 million. The final value, including the actual execution, was $178.5 million. The ship arrived in December 2006 to [[Newport News, VA]] and the work was completed in March 2009. The project was delayed more than eight months because of more than 2,000 project changes. This was a competitive award under a Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) multiple award contract.

In July 2009 two hull cracks, including one in the pressure hull, were discovered during a routine inspection. The Navy has begun an investigation. Although the Navy and Northrop Grumman launched two investigations into welding practices at the yard while ''Toledo'' was under maintenance, the cracks do not appear to be related to welds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Newport News, Va., Daily Press|title=Cracks found in USS Toledo|author=Peter Frost|date=21 July 2009|url=http://www.dailypress.com/business/dp-biz_toledo-submarine_0722jul22,0,3033376.story}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kursk-Toledo collision hypothesis==
{{details|Kursk submarine disaster}}
French filmmaker Jean-Michel Carré, in ''Kursk: a Submarine in Troubled Waters'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vR2MIriTCY ''« Koursk » : un sous-marin en eaux troubles'' 70 mn documentary&lt;/ref&gt; which aired on 7 January 2005 on French TV channel ''[[France 2]]'', alleged that ''Kursk'' sank because of a sequence of events triggered by a collision with the ''Toledo''. According to Carré, ''Kursk'' was performing tests with [[VA-111 Shkval|''Shkval'']] torpedoes and the tests were being observed by two US submarines on duty in the region, USS ''Toledo'' and {{USS|Memphis|SSN-691}}.

'''USS ''Santa Fe'' (SSN-763)''', a {{sclass|Los Angeles|submarine}}, was the second ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]. The contract to build her was awarded to the [[Electric Boat]] Division of [[General Dynamics]] Corporation in [[Groton, Connecticut]] on 21 March 1986 and her keel was laid down on 9 July 1991. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 12 December 1992 sponsored by Mrs. Joy Johnson, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 8 January 1994, with Commander Rodger P. Krull in command.

==Operational history==
''Santa Fe'''s maiden deployment was in 1997 to the [[Persian Gulf]] and Western Pacific.  In 1998, she completed a Selected Rectricted Avialability in Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard.  In 1999, she was again deployed to the Persian Gulf and Western Pacific earning a [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]] and Coast Guard [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]]. In 2001, she deployed to the Western Pacific and Persian Gulf earning two Meritorius Unit Commendations as well as earning her first coveted CSS-7 Battle E. 
 
''Santa Fe'' deployed to the Western Pacific in September 2003 until March 2004. For this deployment she participated in ANNUALEX '03 with the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force|Japanese Maritime Defense Force]]. The ship made port calls in Singapore, [[Guam]], multiple times in [[Sasebo, Japan]], and in [[Yokosuka, Japan]] in which she rode out a typhoon while in port. ''Santa Fe'' was awarded the [[Navy Unit Commendation]], the second highest award given to a submarine, for actions completed on this deployment. She underwent a three-month Interim drydocking in October 2004.

After the ship completed sea trials and other various workups she then completed a two-month Eastern Pacific Deployment that started in May 2005. After returning to her homeport of Pearl Harbor in June 2005, she again deployed to the Western Pacific on 9 August 2005. During this deployment she participated in [[Malabar 2007|Exercise Malabar]] with the Indian Navy. ''Santa Fe'' was the second U.S. nuclear submarine to participate in the exercise and also to port in [[Goa|Goa, India]]. After Malabar, the ship made a brief stop in [[Phuket Province|Phuket, Thailand]]. She was the first U.S. submarine to visit Phuket since 2001. The ship returned to Pearl Harbor in February 2006. She made the transit to the East Coast in July 2006, surfacing near the North Pole on the way.

USS ''Santa Fe'' completed a major repair period lasting 18 months at the [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]] in [[Kittery, Maine]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} After undergoing sea trials at [[Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay]], Georgia and transiting through the Panama Canal, she has returned to her homeport of Pearl Harbor, HI.

After shipyard she completed a six-month Western Pacific deployment from May–November 2009, after stops in Singapore, [[Saipan]], [[Guam]], [[Okinawa]], JP, and [[United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka]], JP.  
She received the Battle &quot;E&quot; Award in January 2010.

''Santa Fe'' returned 24 August 2011 to [[Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam]] after successfully completing a six-month deployment to the western Pacific region.  During this deployment ''Santa Fe'' skillfully conducted four operations of great importance to national security by safely operating in a demanding and challenging undersea environment, directly enhancing fleet, theater and national objectives. The crew displayed exceptional tactical skill, tenacity and perseverance while operating under extremely challenging conditions to prepare the battle space for future operations. ''Santa Fe'''s tactical acumen was further displayed by their highly successful participation in [[Exercise Malabar]], a bilateral exercise with the Indian navy.  
Port calls included [[Sasebo, Japan]] (x3), [[Chinhae]], South Korea; [[Yokosuka, Japan]]; [[Guam]], and [[Subic Bay, Philippines]]. 
In recognition of their outstanding performance, ''Santa Fe'' received the COMSUBRON 7 Battle &quot;E&quot; Award and was awarded the [[Navy Unit Commendation]] by the [[Secretary of the Navy]].

'''USS ''Miami'' (SSN-755)''' was a [[United States Navy]] {{sclass|Los Angeles|attack submarine}}. She was the third vessel of the U.S. Navy to be named after [[Miami|Miami, Florida]]. Miami is the 44th Los Angeles Class (688) attack submarine and the 5th Improved Los Angeles Class (688I) to be built and commissioned. The contract to build her was awarded to the [[General Dynamics Electric Boat|Electric Boat]] division of [[General Dynamics|General Dynamics Corporation]] in [[Groton, Connecticut]], on 28 November 1983 and her keel was laid down on 24 October 1986.  She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 12 November 1988 and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 30 June 1990 with Commander Thomas W. Mader in command.

On 1 March 2012 ''Miami'' pulled into the [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]] in [[Kittery, Maine]] for a scheduled 20-month Engineered Overhaul (EOH) and system upgrades.  A civilian employee started a fire aboard the boat on 23 May 2012. It impacted the forward compartment of the submarine which includes crew living, command and control spaces and torpedo room. The revised estimate to restore the USS ''Miami'' increased to approximately $450 million with completion estimated on 30 April 2015.  Due to [[Budget sequestration in 2013|budget cuts]], it was announced 6 August 2013 that the vessel would not be repaired and placed on the inactive list.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kjonline.com/news/Navy-abandons-plan-to-fix-nuclear-sub.html&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 March 2014, the USS ''Miami'' was formally decommissioned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militarytimes.com/article/20140328/NEWS/303280014/Decommissioning-today-fire-damaged-sub-Miami Decommissioning today for fire-damaged sub Miami] - Militarytimes.com, 28 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

At 5:41 p.m. EDT on 23 May 2012, fire crews were called with a report of a fire on the USS ''Miami'' while being overhauled at the [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]] in [[Kittery, Maine]].

Originally the U.S. Navy reported that the fire started when an industrial vacuum cleaner, used &quot;to clean worksites on the sub after shipyard workers’ shifts,&quot; sucked up a heat source that ignited debris inside the vacuum. On 23 July 2012; Casey J. Fury, a civilian painter and sandblaster working on the sub, was indicted on two counts of arson after confessing to starting the fire. Fury admitted to setting the 23 May fire by igniting some rags on the top bunk of a bunk room.  He claimed to have started the fire to get out of work early&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/new_hampshire/articles/2012/06/29/navy_no_update_on_uss_miami_investigation/|title=Navy: No update on USS Miami investigation|work=boston.com|accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120723/NEWS/120729932/-1/NEWSMAP |title=Suspect in $400M sub blaze appears in court |work=seacoastonline.com |accessdate=2012-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcvb.com/news/local/boston-north/Man-charged-in-fire-on-USS-Miami/-/11984708/15641884/-/eeu7f9z/-/index.html|title=Man charged in fire on USS Miami|work=www.wcvb.com |accessdate=2012-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Civilian worker charged with setting both fires aboard, near submarine in Maine shipyard|  url=http://www.newser.com/article/da06ofmg3/civilian-worker-charged-with-setting-both-fires-aboard-near-submarine-in-maine-shipyard.html | agency=[[Associated Press]] |year=2012 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120723172145/http://www.newser.com/article/da06ofmg3/civilian-worker-charged-with-setting-both-fires-aboard-near-submarine-in-maine-shipyard.html| archivedate=2012-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 March 2013; Fury was sentenced to over 17 years in federal prison and ordered to pay $400 million in restitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/15/justice/maine-submarine-arson-sentence/index.html?iref=obnetwork Shipyard worker sentenced to 17 years for $400 million submarine fire]&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Navy debated on whether to scrap the boat. Both of Maine's Senators, [[Susan Collins]] and [[Olympia Snowe]], advocated repairing her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressherald.com/news/navy-fire-on-nuclear-sub-started-in-vacuum_2012-06-07.html |title=Navy: Fire on nuclear sub started in vacuum cleaner |publisher=Pressherald.com |date=7 June 2012 |accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Navy asked Congress to add $220 million to the operations and maintenance budget for emergent and unfunded ship repairs which would be used to help repair the Miami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theday.com/article/20120720/NWS09/307209962/-1/NWS|title=Links to USS Miami fire explored|work=theday.com|accessdate=2012-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final outcome was a choice to repair the submarine at an estimated total cost of $450 million.  The USS ''Miami'' was expected to return to service sometime in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courant.com/business/hc-us-submarine-20120822,0,234505.story|title=USS Miami Expected Back In Service In 2015 |work=www.courant.com |accessdate=2012-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, congressional inaction to fully resolve the [[United States fiscal cliff]] had put this in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navytimes.com/news/2013/03/ap-navy-says-submarine-miami-repairs-uncertain-031813/ &quot;Navy: Repairs to submarine Miami now uncertain.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

To keep costs down, spare parts from the recently decommissioned {{USS|Memphis|SSN-691}} were to be used to repair ''Miami''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.therepublic.com/view/story/f743aa38a4b94bc99c8559232027092c/CT--Submarine-Fire{{dead link|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, integrity checks on the hull did not show changes to its metallurgy or strength; fixing the internal sections would be much cheaper than replacing hull sections.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/South-Beached-Fire-and-Fixes-aboard-USS-Miami-07539/ Fire and Fixes aboard USS Miami] - Defenseindustrydaily.com, 2 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; At first glance, it seemed more prudent to repair the USS ''Miami'' in the same manner as the {{USS|San Francisco|SSN-711}} since such a repair would cost &quot;only&quot; (around) 80 million USD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navytimes.com/news/2008/10/navy_sub_surgery_102108w/ |title=Transplant complete, attack sub floats again - Navy News &amp;#124; News from Afghanistan &amp; Iraq |publisher=Navy Times |date=|accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it should be noted that the hull of the USS ''Memphis'' was already 26 years old (as of 2012). ''Memphis'' is also a different version (or &quot;flight&quot;) of 688 submarine, as it was not built with the vertical launch system that the newer ''Miami'' has,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.public.navy.mil/subfor/csg2/Pages/USSMemphis(SSN691).aspx&lt;/ref&gt; thus making the Memphis' hull incompatible with that of ''Miami''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

On 6 August 2013, the U.S. Navy announced it will scrap the USS ''Miami'', concluding the cost of repairs is more than it can afford in a time of [[Budget sequestration in 2013|budget cuts]].  A &quot;comprehensive damage assessment&quot; found that while the ''Miami'' could have theoretically been repaired, the necessary repairs were more extensive than first anticipated.  This raised the expected repair costs from $450 million to $700 million.  At that cost, repairing the ''Miami'' would have required cancellation of work on dozens of other submarines and surface ships.  In the end, the Navy determined that repairing the ''Miami'' was not considered worth weakening overall fleet readiness.  One factor in the heightened cost estimate was the effect of &quot;environmentally-assisted cracking&quot; in the steel piping and fasteners used in the air, hydraulic, and cooling water systems, which required more equipment to be replaced than previously thought. The U.S. Navy will lose five deployments ''Miami'' was to make over the ten years that remained in its service life, but funds will be used to support other vital maintenance efforts to improve the wholeness and readiness of the fleet.&lt;ref&gt;http://navylive.dodlive.mil/2013/08/07/uss-miami-a-tangible-impact-to-readiness-from-sequestration&lt;/ref&gt;  The sub was officially decommissioned on 28 March 2014 .&lt;ref&gt;McDermott, Jennifer, &quot;[http://www.stripes.com/news/us/fire-stricken-submarine-uss-miami-is-decommissioned-1.275179#.UziilcKRVZI Fire-stricken submarine USS Miami is decommissioned]&quot;, ''[[The Day]]'', 29 March 2014; reprinted in ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper|Stars and Stripes]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The USS ''Miami'' is the first submarine and nuclear-powered ship to be lost in a U.S. naval shipyard, and the second warship lost in a U.S. naval shipyard after the destruction of [[USS Merrimack (1855)|USS ''Merrimack'']] in 1861.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Commanding officers==
USS Miami has been commanded by eleven commanding officers (COs), all with the equivalent rank of [[commander]]. 

Commander Rolf B. Spelker serves as Miami's eleventh and current commanding officer after assuming command from Commander Roger E. Meyer at [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]]. Spelker initially served as the Executive Officer of [[USS Albany (SSN-753)]] before assuming command aboard Miami from Meyer; Who will serve as deputy commander of [[Submarine Squadron 6]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. Upon the Navy's announcement of Miami's decommissioning; Meyer served as Miami's last commanding officer to have deployed with the ship itself. 
The ship's initial start of the original engineering overhaul (EOH) and later fire recovery overhaul were seen over by Meyer from March 2012 to November 2013. Spelker will serve and oversee the ship's defueling of the ship's [[nuclear reactor]], inactivation, and decommissioning.

'''USS ''Scranton'' (SSN-756)''', a {{sclass|Los Angeles|submarine}}, is the second ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]. 

The contract to build her was awarded to [[Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding|Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company]] in [[Newport News, Virginia]], on 26 November 1984, and construction began on 29 August 1986.  She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 3 July 1989 sponsored by Mrs. Sarah McDade, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 26 January 1991, with Commander J.G. Meyer in command.

''Scranton'' was the first submarine at Newport News to be built via &quot;modular construction&quot;.  No keel was laid.  In this method, the ship was almost fully built out in individual hull sections.  Most of the internal structure, machinery, and piping were loaded in via open ends of the hull sections as each hull section was built out.  The individual hull sections were later assembled with exact precision such that piping running between the sections was joined as the hull sections were welded together.  The ship was later rolled into a floating drydock and &quot;floated&quot;  

In January 2006, ''Scranton'' successfully demonstrated homing and docking of an AN/BLQ-11 [[Long-Term Mine Reconnaissance System]] (LMRS) [[unmanned undersea vehicle]] (UUV) system during at-sea testing under the leadership of Commanding Officer Michael J. Quinn.[http://www.news.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=22618]

'''CityFlyer Express''' was an independent,&lt;ref group=nb&gt;independent from [[government-owned corporation]]s&lt;/ref&gt; short-haul [[regional airline]] with its head office in the Iain Stewart Centre adjacent to [[London Gatwick Airport]] in [[Crawley]], [[West Sussex]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;World Airline Directory.&quot; ''[[Flight International]]''. 24–30 March 1999. [http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1999/1999%20-%200644.html?search=%22CityFlyer%20Express%22 64]. &quot;Iain Stewart Centre, Beehive Ring Road, Gatwick Airport, Gatwick, West Sussex, RH6 OPB, UK&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 it became the first [[British Airways]] (BA) [[franchising|franchisee]] operating as ''British Airways Express''. CityFlyer's ownership passed to BA in 1999 when that company bought out the original promoters as well as [[3i]], the airline's main shareholder at the time. Initially, CityFlyer continued to operate as a separate unit, but it was eventually absorbed into British Airways' mainline short haul operation at [[London Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] in 2001, the result of a change in British Airways' strategy for its Gatwick operation.

Following its absorption into British Airways, the airline's [[turboprop]]s were retired, while the company's fleet of regional short-haul [[Jet airliner|jetliners]] and the associated crews were transferred to British Airways' regional operation in [[Birmingham]] and [[Manchester]]. This in turn resulted in British Airways mainline short haul crews based at Gatwick operating most of the erstwhile CityFlyer Express routes using the former's Gatwick-based [[Boeing 737]] fleet.

===CityFlyer's origins===
CityFlyer Express can be traced back to the formation of Connectair in 1983. Connectair became a feeder airline for [[British Caledonian]], at the time the UK's so-called Second Force airline, on 30 May 1984 when it commenced a regional scheduled service between [[Gatwick]] and [[Antwerp]] with a single, leased [[Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante]] turboprop. A small number of larger capacity, more efficient [[Shorts 330]] turboprops eventually replaced the Embraer Bandeirante.

There was joint ticketing for both airlines, Connectair flight numbers were prefixed with British Caledonian's '''BR''' designator, the two-letter [[IATA]] code identifying the airline on whose behalf a flight is operated, and all of the company's aircraft were painted in the ''British Caledonian Commuter'' [[aircraft livery|livery]]. However, this relationship stopped short of a [[Franchising|franchise]] agreement.

Following British Airways' takeover of British Caledonian in December 1987, Connectair operated its flights under the UK flag carrier's '''BA''' designator without adopting the British Airways livery for an interim period.

===The ILG era===
In June 1988 the firm was acquired by the International Leisure Group (ILG), the parent company of [[Air Europe]]. Following ILG's acquisition of Connectair, the airline was re-branded ''Air Europe Express'' and adopted a new [[corporate identity]] as of 1 February 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;friends123&quot;&gt;''It was nice to fly with friends! The story of Air Europe.'', Simons, G.A., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1999, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

ILG's decision to purchase Connectair was part of Air Europe's [[strategic management|corporate strategy]] at the time to establish itself as a major short haul scheduled operator at its Gatwick base. Gatwick had become very busy during the late 1980s. This meant that the much-coveted early-morning peak time [[airport slots|slots]], which Air Europe needed to be able to operate at times that were attractive to business travellers as well as competitive with its rivals' departure and arrival times, were in increasingly short supply. Connectair held a fairly large number of conveniently timed slots at Gatwick, which it had accumulated since its ''British Caledonian Commuter'' days. ILG's acquisition of Connectair therefore represented a golden opportunity to substantially increase the number of slots the group's airlines controlled at Gatwick, thereby strengthening Air Europe's competitive position at that airport.&lt;ref name=&quot;friends123&quot;/&gt;

Air Europe Express flew under the same '''AE''' airline designator as its bigger sister airline.

Its scheduled services initially linked Gatwick with Antwerp and [[Rotterdam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;friends122&quot;&gt;''It was nice to fly with friends! The story of Air Europe.'', Simons, G.A., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1999, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

Larger [[Shorts 360]]s gradually replaced the Shorts 330s.&lt;ref name=&quot;friends122&quot;/&gt;

In addition, ILG purchased Guernsey Airlines in April 1989, another small, independent regional airline, which operated scheduled services between [[Guernsey]] and Gatwick as well as between Guernsey and Manchester at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1983/1983%20-%201532.html ''British commuters grow - British Air Ferries/Guernsey Airlines'', Flight International, 20 August 1983, p. 498]&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 October 1989 ILG fully integrated Guernsey Airlines into its existing Air Europe Express operation.&lt;ref&gt;''It was nice to fly with friends! The story of Air Europe.'', Simons, G.A., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1999, pp. 123/4&lt;/ref&gt;

These moves provided Air Europe with additional transfer traffic for its developing short haul [[Europe]]an scheduled route network. They also enabled Air Europe to launch new routes where there was insufficient traffic to support its larger Boeing 737 and [[Fokker 100]] [[jet aircraft]] or where these aircraft were too big to provide a frequent schedule during the start-up phase, such as Gatwick—[[Düsseldorf]] and Gatwick—[[Jersey]] for instance.

Following the replacement of the Air Europe Express Shorts 360 turboprops with Air Europe's larger and faster Fokker 100 jets on the Gatwick—Düsseldorf and Gatwick—Jersey routes, Air Europe Express launched a new thrice-daily Gatwick—[[Birmingham]] schedule with its Shorts 360s.&lt;ref&gt;''It was nice to fly with friends! The story of Air Europe.'', Simons, G.A., GMS Enterprises, Peterborough, 1999, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

During the year ending August 1990 the Air Europe Express operation carried more than a quarter of a million passengers across its route network for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;friends123&quot;/&gt;

Air Europe Express was forced to halt its operations on 8 March 1991 along with its sister airlines in the ILG-controlled ''Airlines of Europe'' group as a result of its parent company's decision to put all the group's companies into administrative receivership on that day, even though Air Europe Express itself had remained profitable throughout that period.

===A new beginning===
The management of Air Europe Express quickly started a new airline, Euroworld Airways, and began operations in May 1991 using two Shorts 360 aircraft and staff from the old Air Europe Express. The new carrier also carried on night freight and mail contracts from the defunct airline. The airline soon began flights from Gatwick to Guernsey, Antwerp and Rotterdam, for which two additional Shorts 360s were purchased. At this time, the airline approached several large carriers with a view to establishing a link, but in the event only British Airways was to show any interest, and a [[code share]] agreement was struck between the two.

====Choosing a new corporate identity====
The airline rebranded as ''CityFlyer Express'' in 1992.

1992 also marked CityFlyer's second year of operation, during which it managed to [[break even]] for the first time. (It had recorded a loss of [[Pound sterling|£]]0.5[[million|mn]] in its first year of operation.)

From this point onwards, the airline was to post a consistent [[Profit (accounting)|profit]].

====Launching a new generation of turboprop planes in the UK====
CityFlyer Express was the UK launch customer for the [[ATR 42]] regional turboprop, acquiring two in 1992.

In the same year [[Aer Lingus]] abandoned the Gatwick to [[Dublin]] service, allowing CityFlyer to step in with a daily service.

BA's takeover of [[Dan-Air#Closing chapter|Dan-Air]] also left the Gatwick to [[Newcastle Airport|Newcastle]] route vacant for the airline to assume, offerig a three-times daily service and requiring a third ATR 42.

The addition of Düsseldorf to the network in 1993 and a frequency increase on the Dublin route led to the acquisition of a fourth ATR.

===Formalisation of code-share relationship with British Airways===
Meanwhile, the code share agreement had resulted in several complaints being lodged with British Airways by customers expecting a BA flight and the BA product.

BA proposed a solution to this by offering CityFlyer a franchise agreement, which it accepted. This occasion marked the conclusion of the first-ever franchise agreement between British Airways and another airline. It also marked the conclusion of the first franchise agreement in the UK airline industry.

Under this arrangement the CityFlyer aircraft would be painted in full BA livery with interiors and cabin layout conforming to BA's contemporary, standard two-class European product. Staff would wear BA uniforms and all flights would operate under BA flight numbers. British Airways itself would take over CityFlyer's marketing and handle all reservations on its behalf. To all intents and purposes, CityFlyer Express would present itself and trade as British Airways.

The deal came into effect in June 1993.

===Further expansion===
The franchise agreement allowed CityFlyer Express to take advantage of the UK flag carrier's marketing clout, [[pricing power]] as well as its [[global distribution system]] ([[GDS]]) and worldwide sales force.

The airline was again UK launch customer for the larger, 66-seat [[ATR 72]], the first of which was delivered in October 1994.

By the end of the 1995 financial year, CityFlyer served ten destinations.

===Ushering in the jet age===
CityFlyer Express acquired its first jet aircraft in March 1997 when it became the first UK-based airline to introduce the [[BAe 146|Avro RJ100]]. A second Avro RJ100 was acquired in May of that year. Three more were added in 1998 and a further two joined the fleet in 1999. (At the time, the airline also operated six ATR 42s, one of which was returned to its lessor in 1999, as well as five larger ATR 72s. Three additional ATR 72s were delivered in 1999. Eventually, these replaced the remaining ATR 42s.)

By the turn of the millennium the company's jet fleet had expanded to 16 RJ100s.

===Selling out to British Airways===
With the franchise agreement due to end in 1999, CityFlyer Express was the second largest slot holder at Gatwick Airport (behind British Airways). It held 96 daily slots at Gatwick, employed 677 people and returned a pre-tax profit of £6.4mn on [[sales]] of £89.4mn. The airline’s shareholders took the opportunity to realise their [[investment]] and put the airline up for sale. [[HSBC]] was appointed to handle the process, and approached a number of carriers about the sale. Of the airlines approached, both British Airways and [[Virgin Atlantic Airways|Virgin Atlantic]] stated their interest to acquire the airline.

At the time Virgin chairman [[Richard Branson]] attacked British Airways' intention to bid for CityFlyer Express by claiming publicly that it already had a &quot;total [[monopoly]]&quot; at [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]] and now wanted a &quot;total monopoly&quot; at Gatwick as well, thereby undermining its rivals' ability to compete with it on a [[level playing field]].
  
Disregarding a publicly stated offer from Virgin Atlantic to purchase the company for £100mn, HSBC announced the sale of CityFlyer Express to Virgin's archrival British Airways for £75mn in November 1998. This immediately caused controversy, with Richard Branson stating that HSBC never responded to Virgin’s offer despite numerous requests from Virgin. CityFlyer's management defended its decision to sell to British Airways by stating that it had never received Virgin's [[Bid price|bid]] in the first place.

This resulted in the already agreed takeover of CityFlyer Express by British Airways being referred to the [[Competition Commission]].

The Competition Commission eventually cleared the sale of CityFlyer Express to British Airways for £75mn in 1999. However, it also imposed a ceiling on the maximum number of slots British Airways and its newly acquired subsidiary CityFlyer Express were allowed to hold at Gatwick.

According to this ruling, British Airways and CityFlyer could control a combined maximum of 41% of all Gatwick slots on an annual basis as well as no more than 70% of the airport's slots on an hourly basis and up to 65% of these slots within a two-hour time span. These limits were designed to enable other airlines to offer competitive schedules on short haul routes where British Airways or CityFlyer was the sole or dominant carrier, without resorting to compulsory slot transfers that would have impeded British Airways' ability to run an effective [[hub-and-spoke]] operation at Gatwick.

====Background to British Airways' acquisition of CityFlyer Express====
The main reason for British Airways' acquisition of CityFlyer Express was the fact that CityFlyer held about 13% of Gatwick slots at the time. BA did not want these to fall into any competitor's hands. BA also needed CityFlyer's slots to expand its Gatwick operation so that it could offer enough [[feeder]] services that would help it turn around its loss-making operation at the airport by improving long haul load factors. It was hoped that this would shore up the profitability of the UK flag carrier's long haul routes from Gatwick, thereby enabling it to return the entire Gatwick operation to profitability in the long term.

CityFlyer and its predecessor Connectair had a proven track record of operating a network of regional domestic and European scheduled services from Gatwick profitably. This was in stark contrast to BA's mainline short haul operation at Gatwick, which had racked up huge losses ever since BA had established a major presence at Gatwick as a result of the British Caledonian and Dan-Air takeovers. The losses BA's mainline short haul services generated at Gatwick were at the heart of the unsatisfactory financial performance of the entire Gatwick operation. After the failed attempt to use the acquisition of Dan-Air, which was on the verge of bankruptcy at the end of October 1992, to form a new low-cost, short haul unit within BA's mainline short haul operation at Gatwick, franchising seemed to offer the best solution for providing the level of feeder services BA needed to protect its long-haul loads and profits at Gatwick, without re-creating the complex organisation and fleet mix, and without duplicating the costly [[overheads]] of the BA mainline short haul operation at Heathrow, which did not suit the [[revenue]] environment at Gatwick. Apart from the additional transfer traffic this generated for BA's long haul services at Gatwick, the main benefit of this arrangement for BA was that CityFlyer was to remain completely independent of the BA mainline operation. The feeder services CityFlyer provided for BA at Gatwick under the franchise agreement did not impact the direct operating [[cost]]s of BA's mainline operation. CityFlyer also had very low costs as a result of a flat organisational structure and a simple fleet. This suited Gatwick's revenue environment and was the main reason BA decided to make the franchise agreement with CityFlyer Express a central plank of its strategy to achieve sustained, overall profitability at Gatwick.

=====BA's inability to operate profitably at Gatwick following the acquisition of British Caledonian and Dan-Air=====
The prime causes for BA's inability to operate profitably at Gatwick are:

* The unwieldy route structure it inherited from British Caledonian.

* The [[Monopolies and Mergers Commission]]'s decision to require BA to give up 5,000 annual slots at Gatwick to its competitors and to re-apply for some of British Caledonian's short haul feeder routes, as well as the subsequent decision of the [[Civil Aviation Authority of the United Kingdom|Civil Aviation Authority]] (CAA) to award these routes to rival airlines.

* Its failure to transform the short haul operation inherited from Dan-Air into a low-cost unit within the Gatwick mainline short haul operation.

* The fact that on identical routes with the same fare structure its costs at Gatwick are only marginally lower than at Heathrow, whereas load factors, revenues and [[yield management|yield]]s — the profit per passenger — are significantly lower at Gatwick than at Heathrow.

* Gatwick's location and its smaller catchment area compared with Heathrow.

The route structure with which BA was left following its takeover of British Caledonian in December 1987 was notable for the unplanned and unsystematic manner in which it had grown since the early 1960s.

At the time the late [[Sir Freddie Laker]] had begun building up [[British United Airways]]' scheduled route network in his capacity as that airline's managing director. In those days only very limited opportunities existed for wholly privately owned, independent airlines to provide fully fledged scheduled air services on major domestic and international trunk routes. This resulted in a poor fit of many routes in British United's network of scheduled services, thereby making it difficult to offer sensible connections that could be marketed to the travelling public. It also represented the best network structure the late Sir Freddie was able to put in place under the then prevailing regulatory regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;nofrills132&quot;&gt;''No Frills - The Truth behind the Low-cost Revolution in the Skies'', Calder, S., Virgin Books, London, 2002, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

British Caledonian, which BA acquired at the end of 1987 in what was widely acknowledged to be a rescue deal to prevent that airline from going under and its assets to pass into the hands of foreign-owned or -controlled competitors, had inherited British United's scheduled route structure at the time of its creation in late November 1970 when that carrier was taken over by [[Caledonian Airways]].

The most fitting description for the resulting network of domestic, European and intercontinental long haul scheduled services from Gatwick was a motley collection of routes resembling a rag bag. This made it difficult to develop profitable streams of transfer traffic using Gatwick as a [[airline hub|hub]]. For this reason it was always going to be a challenge to persuade people to fly to Gatwick from relatively minor places like [[Genoa]] or Jersey in order to make an onward connection at the airport to what many people would consider secondary places in [[Africa]] or [[South America]], and an even greater challenge to do this profitably.&lt;ref name=&quot;nofrills132&quot;/&gt;

At the height of its commercial success in the late 1970s and early 1980s, British Caledonian managed to turn the dilemma the structure of its route network presented to its advantage by focusing on those routes that carried a very high proportion of potentially very profitable, oil-related, premium business traffic. It even managed to become the preferred carrier of many high-ranking [[oil industry]] executives based in [[Texas]], the centre of the global oil industry, by providing convenient, hassle-free connections between [[Houston]]/[[Dallas]], [[Lagos]] and [[Tripoli]] via the airline's Gatwick base. However, the downside of this initially successful strategy was that it made the company dependent on a small number of markets whose fortunes were tied to the commodity price cycle, in often unstable parts of the world, for most of its profits.

Although this worked in British Caledonian's favour when the price of a barrel of crude oil was sky-high during the late '70s/early '80s, it started working against it when the oil price collapsed in the mid-'80s. It also further compounded the firm's growing financial problems at the time, culminating in the financial crisis that led to its takeover by archrival BA.

In July 1987 BA publicly announced its intention to take over its ailing, home-grown rival British Caledonian. This led to a counter bid from ILG who sought to take over British Caledonian themselves and merge it with Air Europe.

Although Air Europe eventually failed to merge with British Caledonian, its management succeeded in having the rival BA bid referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC), a forerunner of today's Competition Commission, by claiming that this deal would destroy the UK's entire independent airline sector if approved without requiring BA to make any concessions to redress the resulting competitive imbalance.

The decision by the MMC to require BA to give up 5,000 annual slots at Gatwick to competitors and to re-apply for some of British Caledonian's most important short haul feeder routes, as well as the subsequent decision by the CAA to award all of these routes to rival, independent airlines left BA's Gatwick operation with only ten short haul routes. This reduction in the number of short haul routes the airline continued to serve from Gatwick was accompanied by a corresponding reduction in the company's Gatwick-based short haul fleet from 14 to ten Boeing 737-200 Advanced aircraft.

The routes the CAA had awarded BA's independent rivals included the most profitable former British Caledonian short haul routes that had generated a substantial amount of transfer traffic for that airline's Gatwick-based scheduled operation, such as London Gatwick — [[Paris]] [[Charles de Gaulle]] and Gatwick—[[Brussels]]. It also included a number of British Caledonian's loss-making domestic routes, such as Gatwick—[[Glasgow]], Gatwick—[[Edinburgh]] and Gatwick—[[Manchester]], which were important feeder services for that airline's profitable long haul routes.

The loss of these vital routes to rival airlines and the consequent reduction in the number of passengers making connections between BA's short and long haul flights at Gatwick threatened the company's ability to continue operating profitably on the long haul routes it had inherited at Gatwick from British Caledonian.

BA's acquisition of the bulk of Dan-Air's scheduled activities at the end of October 1992 was intended to create the basis for a new in-house, low-cost unit that would enable the airline to reverse the heavy losses its own mainline operation's Gatwick-based short haul services incurred by transferring its entire short haul operation at the airport to the new unit.

To attain this goal, BA's management unilaterally imposed the pay scales and terms of the old Dan-Air employment contracts on the entire workforce of its Gatwick-based short haul operation at the beginning of 1993. This effectively cut average pay for everyone by 20%.&lt;ref name=&quot;nofrills132&quot;/&gt;

Management hoped this decision would help bring its short haul operation's costs in line with what Gatwick's revenue environment could sustain to enable it to return to profitability.

However, BA's unilateral decision to force everyone working for its short haul operation at Gatwick to take a pay cut caused bitter feelings towards the company, among both former Dan-Air staff as well as BA's existing employees at Gatwick who were already working for its short haul operation there prior to Dan-Air's acquisition. The former, who were now officially members of the BA family, were upset that they did not enjoy the same pay and terms of employment as the other family members who were working for its long haul operation at the same airport as well as those who were based at Heathrow. The latter were equally upset at having their pay and terms of employment downgraded to what they considered the inferior standards of a [[charter airline]], which their employer had saved from bankruptcy at the eleventh hour.

The resulting unrest among BA's Gatwick-based short haul staff culminated in an unofficial, one-day strike during the first quarter of 1993. As a result of this unofficial industrial action, BA was forced to reverse its earlier decision to cut its Gatwick-based short haul workers' pay unilaterally. These events had clearly demonstrated the power of BA's unionised workforce. The power of the unions representing the affected workers as well as the entrenched attitudes of the middle management within BA's complex, hierarchical organisation also meant that the airline was unable to win any concessions that would have helped it offset the additional costs it was going to face in its short haul operation at Gatwick against increased labour productivity, in return for not cutting those workers' pay.

Therefore, BA's attempt to extend the lower pay scales and less generous terms of employment that prevailed at Dan-Air to align the costs of its short haul operation at Gatwick with the airport's revenue environment eventually turned out to be a costly failure.

BA's failure to simplify its complex, hierarchical organisation to enable it to reduce its overheads has been the main reason that has until now prevented the airline from achieving a cost structure that would make its Gatwick operation profitable. This situation has been further compounded by the fact that the company enjoys fewer [[economies of scale]] at Gatwick compared with Heathrow because the firm's operation at the former airport is smaller than the one at the latter.

As a general rule, on average, a full-service scheduled operation at Gatwick with a fare structure that is identical to a similar operation at Heathrow produces a 10% lower load factor. It also generates a 20% lower revenue and results in an up to 25% lower yield.&lt;ref name=&quot;nofrills132&quot;/&gt;

Although the growing presence of aggressive low-cost, &quot;[[no frills]]&quot; airlines on an ever increasing number of UK domestic and European routes since the late 1990s has rendered this rule largely invalid for short to medium haul operations, it is still valid for most long haul operations where the competition from low-cost airlines is still in its infancy.

Heathrow's and Gatwick's respective geographic location as well as the number of people living within each airport's catchment area accounts for this difference in load factors, revenues and yields.

The former has a bigger catchment area than the latter because more people live north of the [[Thames]] than south of it. Heathrow's catchment area includes about three-quarters of [[London]]'s population and roughly two-thirds of the population in the whole of [[Southeast England]]. London is where most of the demand for air travel in the Southeast originates. This means that 5.6mn people in London live in Heathrow's catchment area as opposed to 1.9mn in Gatwick's catchment area (out of an estimated total [[Greater London]] population of 7.5mn). The comparable figures for the Southeast are: 6.7mn people in Heathrow's catchment area as opposed to 3.3mn in Gatwick's catchment area (out of an estimated total population of 10mn).

This is of particular significance for the premium travel market as Heathrow's larger catchment area means that it is able to offer more frequent flights to a greater number of destinations with more conveniently timed connections. This, in turn, helps attract a greater number of business travellers who generally tend to be the airlines' most profitable customers. It also means that there are four to five business travellers in Heathrow's catchment area for every business traveller in Gatwick's catchment area.

On the other hand, the differing sizes of Heathrow's and Gatwick's catchment areas are far less significant for non-premium travel as many people are prepared to travel to an airport outside their catchment area to take advantage of a cheaper flight.

However, the growing presence of aggressive low-cost, &quot;no frills&quot; airlines at [[London Luton Airport|Luton]] and [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted]] respectively in recent years has somewhat diminished Heathrow's advantage in terms of its catchment area, as far as short to medium haul flights are concerned. Like Heathrow, these airports are located north of the Thames where most of the people in London and the Southeast live and their catchment areas, particularly Luton's, overlap with it.

=====BA's failed attempt at a &quot;virtual&quot; merger with American Airlines=====
During the summer of 1996 BA announced that it was planning to enter into a new code- and revenue- as well as profit-sharing alliance with [[American Airlines]].

The planned alliance was the most ambitious and far-reaching commercial airline alliance attempted at the time. It was also dependent on being granted anti-trust immunity by the [[Her Majesty's Government|British Government]] and the [[United States Department of Justice]] as well as the [[European Commission]]'s Competition Directorate. This mega alliance was meant to replace the much more limited code-share agreement BA had with [[US Airways]] since the beginning of 1993, which was not dependent on anti-trust immunity.

The new alliance envisaged merging the [[transatlantic flight|transatlantic]] operations of both airlines by combining all their commercial activities into a joint company, thus making it a &quot;virtual&quot; merger. One of the new alliance's most outstanding features was a plan for an hourly shuttle service between [[London Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]] and [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York JFK]], the world's busiest and most profitable intercontinental air route.

This meant that BA, which at the time only controlled about 38% of all take-off and landing slots at Heathrow, needed to secure additional prime time slots at Heathrow in order to be able to launch the hourly JFK shuttle. In those days secondary slot trading, where airlines buy and sell take-off and landing slots at congested airports, was still in its infancy and there was uncertainty concerning the legality of this activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/eu-clears-way-for-secondary-slot-trading-224689/ ''EU clears way for secondary slot trading '', Flightglobal, 17 June 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In anticipation of gaining all necessary approvals for the proposed alliance — including anti-trust immunity, BA decided to reserve the required slots at Heathrow by moving all long-haul services to [[East Africa|East]], [[Central Africa|Central]] and [[Southern Africa]] (other than those to [[South Africa]] itself) as well as to [[Latin America]] to Gatwick over the 1996 summer timetable period as well as the 1996/7 winter timetable period. BA chose to transfer these routes to Gatwick because they generated lower traffic volumes and were therefore less profitable than its routes to [[North America]], the [[Middle East]], the [[Indian sub-continent]] as well as the [[Far East]]. They also carried relatively few transfer passengers. This meant that the risk of losing these passengers to a competitor because of Gatwick's smaller number of connections compared with Heathrow was fairly low.

BA furthermore decided to transfer a number of barely profitable or wholly loss-making, short haul routes to secondary destinations in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Eastern Europe]] to Gatwick because BA could use these slots far more profitably to operate additional transatlantic services from Heathrow under this alliance.

With the benefit of hindsight, BA had underestimated the strength of the gathering opposition to its planned &quot;virtual&quot; merger with American Airlines. It had also underestimated its opponents' political clout with the regulatory authorities in the UK and the [[United States|US]] as well as the [[European Union]].

At the time Sir Richard Branson publicly referred to this mega alliance as the &quot;alliance from hell&quot;. He feared that it was part of a new BA strategy to drive Virgin Atlantic, BA's main UK-based transatlantic competitor, out of business. He therefore wanted to have it stopped at any cost.

BA's US-based transatlantic rivals, especially those that were denied access to Heathrow under the stringent [[Bermuda II]] regulatory regime, wanted approval of this alliance to be made dependent upon the successful negotiation of a new UK-US &quot;[[Open Skies]]&quot; air services agreement that would supersede Bermuda II and remove all access restrictions to Heathrow.

Eventually, the alliance was effectively killed off when regulators on both sides of the [[Atlantic]] demanded that BA should hand over hundreds of slots at Heathrow and that anti-trust immunity should be withheld for the Heathrow—JFK &quot;flagship&quot; route.

At the same time, BA's senior management had become so preoccupied with this alliance that it did not pay any attention to the fundamental changes that were beginning to re-shape the airline industry at the time. These changes were going to have a profound effect on the commercial environment in which BA was operating. They included the inexorable rise of the low-cost, &quot;no frills&quot; airlines, first and foremost [[EasyJet]] and [[Ryanair]], in BA's own backyard as well as the growing competitive threat posed by the government-assisted recovery of [[Lufthansa]] and [[Air France]], BA's main European full-service, network airline rivals, both of which had been in no position to challenge BA commercially in the early to mid-1990s as they were effectively bankrupt at that time.

For all these reasons the grandiose BA-AA alliance ultimately turned out to be a very costly distraction for BA's management and was the main contributing factor that led to [[Robert Ayling]]'s downfall who happened to be the BA chief executive during that period.

=====Project Jupiter=====
Project &quot;Jupiter&quot; was BA's internal working title for the strategy it had devised to turn the struggling Gatwick operation into a fully fledged hub.

The airline reckoned that this would enable it to turn around the poor overall financial performance of its operation at the airport after years of heavy losses.

BA decided to give its operation there the economies of scale as well as the [[economies of scope|scope]], in terms of flight connections, it considered necessary to attract enough travellers who were prepared to pay fares that were sufficiently high-yield to achieve sustained profitability.

The aim was to make Gatwick the second biggest hub-and-spoke operation on BA's network as well as one of the biggest outside the US.

Within three years from the launch of Project &quot;Jupiter&quot;, the BA mainline operation more than doubled the number of long haul aircraft at Gatwick and increased the number of short haul aircraft at the airport by more than half. In addition, the airline's franchisees, notably CityFlyer Express and [[GB Airways]], increased their Gatwick-based fleets as well. During that period the number of BA passengers passing through Gatwick also doubled.
 
The role BA had assigned its franchisees generally and CityFlyer in particular to make Project &quot;Jupiter&quot; work was to provide feeder services that were expected to be profitable in their own right and enable transfer passengers to connect at ease with BA's long haul services at Gatwick, thereby improving those services' load factors and increasing their profitability. Unlike some of the [[North America]]n commuter carriers that operate under franchise agreements on the same routes as their mainline partners using smaller aircraft at less busy times, BA's franchisees only operated on routes the company's mainline short haul operation could not serve profitably from Gatwick itself due to its higher cost base.

By the turn of the millennium, BA, the firm's franchisees as well as its subsidiaries and partners in the [[Oneworld]] global airline alliance together controlled about 40% of all take-off and landing slots at Gatwick and used a fleet of more than 100 aircraft to serve around 120 destinations worldwide from the airport, more than any other airline from any airport in the UK. Together they carried 8m passengers through Gatwick annually. This accounted for almost 30% of the total number of passengers passing through the airport each year during that period. 45% of the passengers travelling with BA and its affiliated carriers through Gatwick were changing flights there. At the time, CityFlyer Express and the other BA franchisees as well as its subsidiaries and partner airlines at Gatwick accounted for 1,000 of these passengers each day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/Articles/1998/03/25/34711/Widening+the+franchise.html ''Flight Home: Widening the franchise'', Flight International, 25 March 1998 (Flightglobal: Home &gt; News Article)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, BA's attempt to make its Gatwick operation profitable by building it up into a full-scale hub-and-spoke operation failed.

When Sir [[Rod Eddington]] took over as BA's chief executive in 2000, he initiated a root-and-branch review of the airline's worldwide operation with the aim of improving profitability after it had incurred its first net loss since privatisation during the 1999/2000 financial year.

This included a review of the loss-making Gatwick operation.

At the time Rod Eddington stated that BA's Gatwick operation alone had incurred a loss of £40mn before allocating overheads, in spite of having £4.5[[1000000000 (number)|bn]] of assets at the airport, and that it was destroying shareholder value. (Industry sources estimated that during the aforesaid period the total loss for the airline's entire Gatwick operation was £200mn after allocating all overheads.)&lt;ref name=&quot;BA_News&quot;&gt;''BA News'', British Airways plc, Harmondsworth, Middlesex, 20 October 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Life&quot;&gt;''Gatwick Life, (BA axes ten planes''), Life Newspapers, Horley, Surrey, 9 October 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Eddington attributed this loss to Gatwick's failure to attract sufficient high-yield traffic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Life&quot;/&gt; He furthermore stated that Gatwick's loss was entirely accounted for by its mainline short haul operation whose schedules were primarily designed to feed BA's long haul services at the airport. Eddington was of the opinion that this was the wrong way around because there were not enough early morning departures and late-evening arrivals that could have attracted a greater number of locally based business and leisure passengers requiring same-day-return facilities. Also, the long haul route network BA operated from Gatwick at the time strangely resembled the long haul route structure British Caledonian had inherited from British United at the time of its inception three decades earlier. Moreover, in his opinion, the physical constraints imposed on BA's Gatwick operation by the airport's single runway and two terminals meant that the airline could not offer truly competitive schedules, in terms of frequencies and conveniently timed connections. In addition, Eddington also felt that Gatwick's operation was far too fragmented, in terms of what he called the airport's &quot;bewildering array&quot; of operators and their equipment, which substantially increased costs. At the time, in addition to BA's mainline operation, which accounted for the bulk of the airline's scheduled services at Gatwick, all of its UK-based franchisees (with the exception of [[British Mediterranean]] and [[Loganair]]) as well as the company's subsidiaries and partners provided scheduled services at the airport as well, in some cases with a single aircraft on one route only, operating all aircraft types in their combined inventory except [[Concorde]] and some of the smaller commuter planes.&lt;ref name=&quot;BA_News&quot;/&gt;

Independent analysts were also of the opinion that the long haul routes BA chose to transfer from Heathrow to Gatwick mainly served what many people considered secondary destinations in Africa and Latin America. These were generally not the type of destinations to which business people, including those living in Gatwick's catchment area, were travelling. On the other hand, popular destinations for business and leisure travel, such as New York, [[Los Angeles]], [[Chicago]], [[Hong Kong]] or [[Singapore]] were either under-served or not served at all. For instance, at the time BA operated Gatwick's only daily service to New York JFK and there were no direct services from the airport to any of the other aforementioned destinations.&lt;ref name=&quot;business_analysis&quot;&gt;''The Sunday Business (Go must go''), The Business Publishing Ltd., London, 15/16 October 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

These analysts furthermore pointed to the extent and speed of BA's growth in employment at the airport during that time as a major cause of the huge loss incurred by that operation. Within a relatively short time span of only three years, the airline had increased its headcount at Gatwick alone to 8,500. This was more than the entire 7,700-strong worldwide workforce of British Caledonian at its peak during the early part of the summer in 1986. BA had effectively created a miniature version of its Heathrow-based organisational hierarchy at Gatwick, thereby multiplying its overheads and increasing its cost base at the latter airport.&lt;ref name=&quot;business_analysis&quot;/&gt;

In October 2000 BA publicly announced its decision to de-hub Gatwick and to turn it into a regional Southeast airport primarily serving leisure-orientated point-to-point routes where most of the demand originated in the Gatwick catchment area.&lt;ref name=&quot;BA_News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Life&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''No Frills - The Truth behind the Low-cost Revolution in the Skies'', Calder, S., Virgin Books, London, 2002, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

This was part of a new strategy designed to provide services from Gatwick only if there was sufficient demand in the local catchment area and to do it at a cost the local revenue environment could support.&lt;ref name=&quot;BA_News&quot;/&gt;

It was also part of a strategy to deny the low-cost airlines generally and EasyJet in particular the physical space, in terms of airport slots, to continue expanding unabated in the Southeast. The aim of this secondary strategy was to prevent these carriers from posing an ever greater threat to BA's high-cost, mainline short haul operation at Heathrow, which suffered annual losses to the tune of several hundred million pounds during that period.&lt;ref&gt;''Gatwick Life, (BA starts new war on fares''), Life Newspapers, Horley, Surrey, 20 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

BA therefore decided to move all predominantly business-orientated long haul routes (other than those that had to stay at Gatwick due to bilateral constraints, such as its non-stop services to [[Atlanta]], Dallas and Houston) back to Heathrow.  The airline also decided to withdraw all loss-making services from the airport and to simplify its Gatwick-based fleet by reducing the number of aircraft stationed there and operating only two different aircraft types from the airport. Henceforth, all short to medium haul services from Gatwick were to be exclusively operated with Boeing 737s, while [[Boeing 777]]s were to be the only aircraft to ply the long haul routes from the airport.&lt;ref name=&quot;BA_News&quot;/&gt;

This was accompanied by a reduction in BA's headcount at Gatwick to 3,000 as well as the introduction of a common cabin crew pool for both its short and long haul operations at the airport and a number of other cost-cutting measures.&lt;ref&gt;''Skyport, ('Gatwick op must make a profit', says BA''), Gatwick edition, Hounslow, 16 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

=== British Airways' short haul reorganisation ===
Under the franchise agreement it had concluded with BA before being taken over in 1999, CityFlyer Express initially operated as an independent business unit within British Airways serving a number of short haul European and UK regional routes from Gatwick that were completely separate from the services BA's mainline operation provided from the airport.

However, following BA's decision to abandon its hub-and-spoke strategy at Gatwick in October 2000, CityFlyer was subsumed into British Airways' mainline operation at Gatwick in 2001, thereby ceasing to exist as a separate entity.

There were two reasons for fully integrating CityFlyer into BA's mainline short haul operation at Gatwick.

The first of these was operational. Although CityFlyer remained a profitable business in its own right following its acquisition by BA and industry analysts familiar with the company expected it to generate a profit of at least £7mn during BA's 2000/1 financial year, BA found that franchising overall had not been the financial success it had hoped. There were too many franchisees whose administrative and sales support actually cost the airline more than the additional revenue resulting from franchise fees and the connecting traffic its franchise partners generated. Therefore, as far as the bigger picture was concerned, BA's senior management felt that the franchise agreements with its various franchisees, all of which were profitable in their own right, had benefited the franchisees more than itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;business_2000&quot;&gt;''The Sunday Business (BA closes a profitmaker''), The Business Publishing Ltd., London, 22/23 October 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The second reason was related to maintaining good industrial relations between management and the workforce, especially those working for the mainline short haul operation at Gatwick. These workers had always regarded the concept of franchising generally and CityFlyer Express in particular as a [[Trojan horse]]. They feared that BA's long-term strategy was to hand over its entire, heavily loss-making, mainline short haul operation to profitable franchisees such as CityFlyer, thereby threatening many jobs and the terms of employment of the remaining mainline employees. They also feared that BA would eventually resemble a &quot;virtual&quot; airline.&lt;ref name=&quot;business_2000&quot;/&gt;

Therefore, BA's senior management decided that it was prudent to reduce the number of franchise agreements and to make use of franchisees only if it gave BA a presence in markets it did not already serve itself and where there was no prospect of providing such a service profitably through its mainline operation.&lt;ref name=&quot;business_2000&quot;/&gt;

Following the integration of CityFlyer Express into BA's mainline short haul operation at Gatwick, all former CityFlyer employees other than flight crew and engineers working on the jet fleet were made redundant.&lt;ref name=&quot;business_2000&quot;/&gt; The ex-CityFlyer flight crew and engineers whom BA continued to employ were transferred along with their equipment to BA's regional bases in Birmingham and Manchester.

BA's subsequent decision to retire the former CityFlyer turboprop fleet, resulted in the withdrawal of the airline's services from Gatwick to Antwerp, Guernsey and Rotterdam.

In addition, the fact that the integration of low-cost CityFlyer Express into the high-cost BA mainline short haul operation at Gatwick inevitably meant that formerly profitable CityFlyer routes were now burdened with the expensive BA mainline overheads, necessitated the withdrawal of additional BA short haul services from Gatwick over the course of a few years, including CityFlyer’s routes to [[Cologne]] and Düsseldorf.

At the same time, [[British Regional Airlines]], another British Airways franchise operator based on the [[Isle of Man]], was acquired by British Airways as well and in 2002 was merged with British Airways' wholly owned regional subsidiary [[Brymon Airways]] to form [[BA Connect|British Airways Citiexpress]], which would assume the operation of domestic and European services from UK regional airports.

On 1 February 2006, British Airways Citiexpress was renamed [[BA Connect]].

==Facts of interest==
* Brad Burgess was instrumental in setting up Connectair. He was managing director of both Air Europe Express and CityFlyer Express. He is now chairman of [[Astraeus (airline)|Astraeus]].

* Flight numbers in the 7000 and 8000 range used to be allocated to CityFlyer Express-operated British Airways franchise flights. Following CityFlyer's integration into the British Airways mainline operation at Gatwick, the latter's scheduled services from the airport to [[Amsterdam]] [[Schiphol]], [[Bordeaux]], Dublin, Jersey, [[Luxembourg]], [[Nice]] and [[Toulouse]] still used flight numbers in these ranges, thus identifying them as former CityFlyer Express routes.

'''Taddiport''' is a [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in [[North Devon]], [[England]], near [[Great Torrington]]. The name is believed to derive from toad, a place where toads were found. In the [[Middle Ages]] it was a [[leper colony]]. A field system next to the hamlet is still divided up as for the medieval strip system of farming. During the years of operation of the [[Rolle Canal]] the canal had a quay across the river Torridge from Taddiport.&lt;ref name=industarch&gt;''Industrial Archaeology'' Aids to recording (6) page 77&lt;/ref&gt;
Taddiport appears on the early 15th century [[Evesham world map]]; its inclusion has led many to believe that the map-maker hailed from the small hamlet.

The '''Lotus Exige''' {{IPAc-en|ɛ|ɡ|ˈ|z|iː|ʒ}} is a two-door, two-seat [[sports car]] made by [[Lotus Cars]] since 2000. It is essentially a [[coupé]] version of the [[Lotus Elise]], a [[Mid-engine design|mid-engined]] [[Roadster (automobile)|roadster]] in production since 1996.

== Series 1 ==
[[File:Lotus Exige S1 london.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of Exige S1.]]
The original Exige (NA or naturally aspirated Exige) was launched in 2000 and had a 1.8&amp;nbsp;L [[Rover K engine|Rover K Series]] [[internal combustion engine|engine]] in VHPD (Very High Performance Derivative) tune. It produces {{convert|177|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 7,800&amp;nbsp;rpm in standard form.&lt;ref name=&quot;AR02&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Automobil Revue 2002 | editor-last = Nötzli | editor-first = Max | publisher = Büchler Grafino AG | location = Berne, Switzerland | language = German/French | page = 369 | volume = 97 | date = March 7, 2002 | isbn = 3-905-386-02-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also an uncatalyzed &quot;track spec&quot; version with {{convert|192|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} available. The car has a five-speed manual gearbox, and a claimed top speed of {{convert|219|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}. Zero to sixty mph is achieved in 4.7 seconds, with 0-100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.9 seconds.&lt;ref name=&quot;AR02&quot;/&gt;

The first Exige used the round, less aggressive headlights of the first generation Elise, although the Elise was updated soon after the introduction of the Exige. The Series 1 was built until 2002, in 604 examples, and was not replaced until the Series 2 of 2004.&lt;ref name=drivguid&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lotusdriversguide.com/Genealogy/Exige.php | title = Genealogy: Lotus Exige | publisher = Lotus Drivers Guide | last = Ringma | first = Ronald }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Series 2 ==

===Exige (2004-2006)===
[[File:Lotus Exige.jpg|right|thumb|Lotus Exige Series 2]]
In 2004, the Series 2 Exige was introduced. It features a naturally aspirated 1.8 L 16-valve [[overhead camshaft|DOHC]] [[Toyota]]/[[Yamaha]] engine that produces {{convert|190|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} with the Toyota engine designation of [[Toyota ZZ engine|2ZZ-GE]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edmunds&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Drives/FullTests/articleId=115908 | title = Full Test: 2006 Lotus Exige | accessdate = 2008-03-07 | first = Chris | last = Walton | date = 2006-06-28 | publisher = Edmunds Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Compared to the Series 2 Elise, it has a front splitter, fibreglass hardtop roof with roof scoop, rear engine cover, and rear spoiler.  The sole purpose of these [[aerodynamic]] additions to the base Elise is to create more downforce (almost {{convert|100|lb|abbr=on}} of downforce at {{convert|100|mi/h|km/h}} in the Exige versus {{convert|13|lb|abbr=on}} at {{convert|100|mi/h|km/h}} in the Elise).&lt;ref name=&quot;Edmunds&quot;/&gt;

In February 2005, Lotus announced a limited production run of 50 Exiges, using the Toyota engine with a [[supercharger]], that increases the power output to {{convert|243|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. These vehicles were only available in yellow or black, representing the colours of Lotus Sport, and are badged 240R. They have a projected 0-60|mph (0–100&amp;nbsp;km/h) time of 3.9 seconds and 0-100&amp;nbsp;mph (0–160&amp;nbsp;km/h) of 9.9 seconds, with a top speed of {{convert|155|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} at a cost of £44,000.

The North American Exige was unveiled at the [[Los Angeles Auto Show]] in January 2006.

According to Lotus, the standard Exige Series 2 model weighs {{convert|2016|lb|abbr=on}} has the following specifications:{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In February 2006, Lotus announced the Exige S model which used a supercharged [[Toyota]] engine producing {{convert|220|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;MotorTrend&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/coupe/112_0702_2007_lotus_exige_s | title = Newcomers: 2007 Lotus Exige S | accessdate = 2008-03-07 | first = Greg N. | last = Brown | work = MotorTrend | publisher = Source Interlink Media, Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The S was also made available in North American markets as a 2007 model.

According to Lotus, the Exige S model, weighing {{convert|2057|lb|abbr=on}}, has the following specifications:

;Engine:

=== Exige S 240 (2008-2011) ===

In 2008, the Exige S was replaced by the Exige S 240. Power output increased roughly 9% over the outgoing model to {{convert|240|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}. The S 240 also received upgraded [[Automotive Products|AP Racing]] brakes from the Exige Cup 240 and a larger roof scoop utilized by the Exige Cup 255. 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph (0–97&amp;nbsp;km/h) times improved to 4.0 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2008-lotus-exige-s-240-first-drive-review Exige S 240 Review by Car and Driver]&lt;/ref&gt; The S 240 base manufacturer suggested retail price was $65,690.

=== Exige S 260 (2009-2011) ===

The Exige S 260 produced an additional 7% power output over the S 240 resulting in {{convert|257|hp|abbr=on}}. Even with a full fuel tank, extensive use of weight-saving materials such as carbon fiber reduced the vehicle's gross weight to {{convert|2020|lb|abbr=on}} compared to {{convert|2077|lb|abbr=on}} in the S 240. {{convert|0|-|60|mph|abbr=on}} arrived in 4.0 seconds.&lt;ref name=&quot;AutoWeek S260&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoweek.com/article/20090423/CARREVIEWS/904239981|title=Lotus Exige S 260 Sport: Track-happy two-seater gets greater|last=Vaughn|first=Mark|date=2009-04-23|publisher=AutoWeek Magazine|accessdate=2009-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 2009, both the S 240 and S 260 received distinctively new and enlarged rear spoilers mounted to the rear clam instead of the motor bay cover. The base manufacturer suggested retail price for the S 260 was $74,995.

The Exige 265E is a factory-built Exige S optimized to run on [[E85]] fuel, which is 85% [[ethanol]]. The higher [[octane]] of this [[biofuel]] allows for a higher [[compression ratio]] and/or more supercharger [[Turbo boost|boost]]. In this model, which saw the ECU re-mapped as well as upgraded injectors and fuel pump to cope with the new fuel type, the brakes have also been upgraded to four-piston [[Automotive Products|AP Racing]] calipers with increased diameter {{convert|310|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} sport brake pads mated with drilled and vented discs at the front. [[Brembo]] single-piston sliding rear calipers with {{convert|282|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} diameter discs are fitted at the rear. Lotus says it has no intention to build the 265E ('''265''' indicates the approximate horsepower and the '''E''' indicates the &quot;environmentally favourable bio-ethanol E85 fuel&quot; powering the engine) as a production car, and that it is simply a biofuels demonstrator.&lt;ref&gt;Lotus Engineering, &quot;Exige 265E Bio-Fuel: British, Racing and Very Green,&quot; http://www.grouplotus.com/engineering/casestudies.html&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lotus, the Exige 265E model has the following specifications:

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Low-mass X-ray binary.jpg|thumb|Artist's impression of a low-mass [[X-ray binary]] (LMXB): an evolved low-mass yellow sub-giant star transfers mass to a [[neutron star]]. Because the accretor is a compact object, an accretion disc forms, which is the source of the [[X-rays]]. [http://hemel.waarnemen.com/Informatie/Sterren/hoofdstuk6.html#xbs Source]. ]]
An '''Interacting binary star''' is a type of [[binary star]] in which one or both of the component stars has filled or exceeded its [[Roche lobe]].  When this happens, material from one star (the donor star) will flow towards the other star (the accretor).  If the accretor is a compact star, an [[accretion disk]] may form.  The physical conditions in such a system can be complex and highly variable, and they are common sources of cataclysmic outbursts.

A common type of interacting binary star is one in which one of the components is a compact object which is well within its Roche lobe, while the other is an evolved [[giant star]].  If the compact object is a [[white dwarf]], then [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] of material from the evolved star onto the white dwarf's surface may result in its mass increasing to beyond the [[Chandrasekhar limit]].  This can lead to runaway [[thermonuclear reaction]]s and the massive explosion of the star in a [[Type I supernova]].

An example of such a binary star is [[R Canis Majoris]], in which it is thought that the secondary star has exceeded its Roche lobe and transferred mass to the primary star. This has resulted in the early evolution of the secondary star onto the [[subgiant star]] branch, and in exposure of helium-rich material on the surface of the primary, causing it to burn brighter and have a higher [[effective temperature]] than would usually be expected for a star of its mass.&lt;ref name=&quot;VarricattAshok&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1538-3881/117/6/2980/980418.text.html#tb11 |title= &quot;Near-infrared photometric studies of R Canis Majoris&quot; WP Varricatt, NM Ashok - The Astronomical Journal, 17:2980-2997, 1999 June |date= |accessdate=2009-03-08}} &lt;/ref&gt;

An '''irregular variable''' is a type of [[variable star]] in which variations in brightness show no regular [[Frequency|periodicity]]. There are two main sub-types of irregular variable: eruptive and pulsating.

'''Eruptive''' irregular variables are divided into three categories: 

* Group I variables are split into subgroups IA (spectral types O to A) and IB (spectral types F through M). 

* [[Orion variables]], GCVS type IN (irregular and nebulous), indigenous to star-forming regions, may vary by several magnitudes with rapid changes of up to 1 magnitude in 1 to 10 days, are similarly divided by spectral type into subgroups INA and INB, but with the addition of another subgroup, INT, for T Tauri stars, or INT(YY) for YY Orionis stars.

* The third category of eruptive irregulars are the IS stars, which show rapid variations of 0.5 to 1 magnitude in a few hours or days; again, these come in subgroups ISA and ISB.

'''Pulsating''' irregular giants or supergiants, called [[slow irregular variable]]s, are all of late spectral types (K, M, C, or S), and classed as type L-LB for giants and LC for supergiants. How many of these are actually semi-regular variables that simply need more study, remains unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Observing Variable Stars |author=Gerry Arlen Good|year= 2003|publisher=Springer Science|url= http://books.google.com/?id=k9ViYKvKRz0C&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=%22Irregular+variable%22|isbn=978-1-85233-498-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geoffrey Bayldon''' (born 7 January 1924 in [[Leeds]], [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]) is a British actor. After playing roles in many dramas including [[Shakespeare]], he became known for portraying the title role of the children's series ''[[Catweazle]]'' (1970–72), after turning down the opportunity to play both the [[First Doctor|First]] and [[Second Doctor]]s in the long-running [[BBC]] [[science fiction]] [[television series]] ''[[Doctor Who]]''. Bayldon's other long-running parts include the Crowman in ''[[Worzel Gummidge]]'' (1979–81) and [[Magic Grandad]] in the BBC television series ''Watch'' (1995).

Bayldon made several film appearances in the 1960s and 1970s, including ''[[King Rat (1965 film)|King Rat]]'' (1965), ''[[To Sir, with Love]]'' (1967), ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (as [[Q (James Bond)|Q]]) (1967), the Envy segment of ''[[The Magnificent Seven Deadly Sins]]'' (1971), the [[Marc Bolan]]/[[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] film ''[[Born To Boogie]]'' and the film version (''[[Porridge (film)|Porridge]]'') of the television series ''[[Porridge (TV series)|Porridge]]'' (1979) as the Governor.

Among his more recent television appearances was the [[Five (channel)|Five]] game show ''[[Fort Boyard (TV series)|Fort Boyard]]'' (1998).

He also had a guest appearance in ''[[Doctor Who]]'' as Organon in ''[[The Creature from the Pit]]'' (1979). More recently, he has played an alternative [[First Doctor]] in two [[Radio drama|audio plays]] based on the ''Doctor Who'' television series by [[Big Finish Productions]] in the ''Doctor Who Unbound'' series: ''[[Auld Mortality]]'' and ''[[A Storm of Angels]]''.

Other television roles include parts in the dramatisation of ''[[Blott on the Landscape]]'' (1985) and in two episodes of ''[[The Avengers (TV series)|The Avengers]]'' (1961, 1967) and of ''[[Star Cops]]'' (1987). He was in the ''[[Tales of the Unexpected (TV series)|Tales of the Unexpected]]'' episode &quot;Down Among the Sheltering Palms&quot; (1983). He has also appeared in a number of BBC Schools programmes,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tv-ark.org.uk/schools/bbcschoolsprogrammes70s.html&lt;/ref&gt; where he has displayed a number of otherwise unexploited talents (such as singing). In 1993 he played [[Galileo_affair#Dialogue|Simplicio]] in the [[Open University]] video ''[[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s Revolution''. In 2007 he made a guest appearance in ''[[New Tricks (TV series)|New Tricks]]'' as Leonard Casey.

In 1986 Bayldon provided the vocals on [[Paul Hardcastle]]'s &quot;The Wizard&quot; which was also used (without the vocal) as the theme for BBC TV's ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.

The [[NEC Corporation|NEC]] '''PC-100''' was a [[Japan]]ese [[home computer]] available on October 13, 1983. It operated on 8086 [[Central processing unit|CPU]] 7 MHz, 128KB RAM, 128KB VRAM, a Japanese language capable keyboard and a two button [[Computer mouse|mouse]]. It had three models and its color monitor, ''PC-KD651'', which could be used vertically or horizontally, had the price tag of 198,000 yen. Its biggest advantage over other computers of that time was its high graphical capability of 720 by 512 with a selection of 16 color out of 512 color available on its high end ''model30''. Its OS was [[MS-DOS]] and was also equipped with a [[spreadsheet]] program ''Maruchipuran'' (Multiplan) and a text editor ''JS-WORD'' as well as the game [[Lode Runner]].

Far ahead of its time and too costly, PC-100 did not sell well. A complete set with the printer [[PC-PR201]] that could print alphabet, [[hiragana]], [[katakana]] and [[kanji]], came to nearly a million yen. For a comparison, the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Nintendo Family Computer]] released in July of the same year was only 14,800 yen and the vaunted [[Apple Lisa 2]] sold for 2.2 million yen. The cheaper [[PC-9801F2]] also by NEC outsold it. 
* model10 (398,000 yen) - a 5-inch 2D (360KB) floppy disk drive
* model20 (448,000 yen) - two 5-inch 2D floppy disk drives
* model30 (558,000 yen) - two 5-inch 2D floppy disk drives

==Trivia==
Possibly due to the standard inclusion of a mouse, a blue [[anime]] style [[mouse]] with &quot;PC-100&quot; on its chest looking little like the [[Superman]] was used as a promotional character.

[[File:West-fayette-st 1900.jpg|thumb|West Fayette Street c.1900]]

The '''Syracuse Far Westside''' is bounded by Erie Blvd West on the northeast, South Geddes Street on the lower east and Rowland Street on the south. The western border runs from Velasko Road in the south, to South Avery Avenue, Salisbury Road, Myrtle Street and parallel to Charles Avenue in [[Westvale, New York |Westvale]], a section of [[Geddes, New York |Geddes]] ending at Willis Avenue just south of [[Onondaga Lake]] at the railroad tracks.

===Annexation===

In 1886 the village of Geddes was the largest community in the town of Geddes with many homes and businesses. Geddes officially became a town in 1848. &quot;It then included the west side of [[Syracuse, New York |Syracuse]] to Geddes Street, which was the eastern boundary of the town.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;geddes&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Geddes Recalls 150 Years |newspaper=[[The Post-Standard]] |location=Syracuse, New York |first=Robert W. |last=Andrews |year=1998| accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local residents voted to join the city because Syracuse had a paid professional police department, a paid professional fire department and the city was about to obtain an excellent water supply from [[Skaneateles Lake]].

The village of Geddes was annexed by Syracuse on May 20, 1886. &quot;In one day, Geddes lost its town hall, town supervisor, town clerk, town justice, most town board members and three-quarters of its population.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;geddes&quot;/&gt; The residents in the area encouraged the annexation. Twice, entire commercial blocks along Furnace Street (now West Fayette Street) burned to the ground for lack of water and fire protection.&lt;ref name=&quot;geddes&quot;/&gt;

==Landmarks==

When the village of Geddes joined the city in 1886, Major John P. Burnet, who owned a large farm on [[Tipperary Hill]], gave a large hill top plot of land to Syracuse now known as [[Burnet Park]] with the condition that the city spend $6,000 to build roads and plant trees in this new city park.  Burnet was satisfied with the city's efforts, and thus, in 1887, gave the city an additional plot of land, known as the ''Oak Grove'', which is still full of oak trees, on the corner of South Avery Avenue and Whittier Avenue.

The Far Westside includes Tipperary Hill, an Irish neighborhood that is known for its upside-down [[traffic signal]]. Additionally, Burnet Park and the [[Rosamond Gifford Zoo]] are within its limits. The [[Westcott Reservoir]], an excellent sledding location, is also within its limits.

==Demographics==
44 percent of housing in the neighborhood is owner-occupied, close to the citywide average. As of the 2000 census, 6,916 people lived in the Far Westside. 91.3% were White, 8.7% other. 51.9% were female, 48.1% male. The median age was 34.2, and the median household income was $28,006. Registered voters are 38% Democrat, 28% Republican, 26% non-enrolled, and 8% percent other.

'''''Catweazle''''' is a British [[television series]], created and written by [[Richard Carpenter (screenwriter)|Richard Carpenter]] which was produced and directed by [[Quentin Lawrence]] for [[London Weekend Television]] under the LWI (London Weekend International) banner, and screened in the UK on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 1970. A second season in 1971 was directed by David Reid and [[David Lane (director)|David Lane]]. Both series had thirteen episodes each, with [[Geoffrey Bayldon]] playing the leading role.

The series was broadcast in Ireland, Britain, [[Gibraltar]], New Zealand, The Netherlands, Germany, Australia, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Czechoslovakia, Nicaragua and Quebec (Canada). The first episode is available to view in full at the BFI Screenonline site.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.screenonline.org.uk/media/stream.jsp?id=1024348&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
The series featured [[Geoffrey Bayldon]] as the title character, an eccentric 11th century [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] who accidentally (by total immersion in water) [[Time travel|travels through time]] to the year 1969 and befriends a young red-headed boy, Edward Bennett, nicknamed 'Carrot' ([[Robin Davies]]), who spends most of the rest of the series attempting to hide Catweazle from his father (played by [[Charles 'Bud' Tingwell]]) and farmhand Sam (played by [[Neil McCarthy]]). Meanwhile Catweazle searches for a way to return to his own time whilst hiding out in 'Castle Saburac', a disused water tower, with his [[Familiar spirit|familiar]], a [[toad]] called Touchwood.

The second series featured a 12-part [[riddle]] which Catweazle, once more transported to 1970s England, attempts to solve one clue per episode, with the solution (as he thinks) being revealed in the 13th. A third series was in the works and was to be set again on the Bennet's farm, but was never put past draft stage.

Catweazle mistakes all modern technology for powerful [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], (an example of [[Clarke's three laws|Clarke's third law]]), particularly 'elec-trickery' ([[electricity]]) and the 'telling bone' ([[telephone]]).

The entire series was shot on [[16mm film|16mm]]. The first series was mostly shot [[Filming location|on location]] at Home Farm, [[East Clandon]], near Guildford in [[Surrey, England]] in 1969. The second series around the Bayford/Brickendon area in Hertfordshire in 1970.

Although Bayldon thought that the series had run its course after two seasons,&lt;ref&gt;http://scifibulletin.com/uk-tv/catweazle-2/catweazle-geoffrey-bayldon&lt;/ref&gt; he still praised the second, noting that two episodes were, in his view, below standard, but not written by Carpenter: ''There are two episodes I felt that with; the rest I think are lovely. I thought they were dreadful, but they were not written by Richard. They were written when we were behind.''&lt;ref&gt;http://scifibulletin.com/uk-tv/catweazle-2/catweazle-geoffrey-bayldon&lt;/ref&gt; All the episodes are credited as being written by Richard Carpenter, so it is not known to which episodes Bayldon is referring.

The series won the [[Writers' Guild of Great Britain]] award for Best Children's TV Drama Script in 1971. It also inspired the [[Boo Radleys]] song, ''Catweazle''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.booradleys.co.uk/lyrics.php?id=24&lt;/ref&gt;

==DVD Releases==

The first series was released on Region 2 [[DVD]] in the UK by [[Network Distributing]] on 23 May 2005, with a short reunion documentary &quot;Brothers in Magic&quot; and [[Audio commentary|audio commentaries]] on selected episodes by Carpenter, Bayldon, Davies and Executive Producer [[Joy Whitby]]. The second series was released on 29 August 2005. 

In Australia, Catweazle: The Complete Series was released on Friday, 18 May 2007 and distributed through [[Shock Records|Shock]]. On Wednesday, 1 June 2011, Catweazle: Season One and Catweazle: Season Two were released in Region 4 and were also distributed through [[Shock Records|Shock]].

On 29 March 2010, the series was released on [[DVD]] once again by [[Network Distributing]] in the UK to commemorate its 40th anniversary. Amongst several other additional features included was a ‘Westbourne Museum’ image gallery (named after a small local museum in the episode ‘The Curse of Rapkyn’ starring [[Peter Sallis]]) featuring the most comprehensive collection of original Catweazle [[memorabilia]] and promotional [[ephemera]] ever assembled, sourced from [[The Paul Pert Screen Collection]]. The release of the ‘40th Anniversary Special Edition' [[DVD]] set was also accompanied by a commemorative publication called 'The [[Magic (illusion)|Magic]] Book' by authors Simon Wells and [[The Paul Pert Screen Collection|Paul Pert]]. Actor [[Robin Davies]] who played 'Carrot' in the series, died just prior to its release on 22 February 2010 at the age of 56.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/robin-davies-actor-who-found-fame-alongside-wendy-craig-and-catweazle-1969891.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/obituaries/2010/03/robin-davies/&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the publication includes an article by [[The Paul Pert Screen Collection|Paul Pert]] about the longevity of the Catweazle phenomenon, entitled ‘A Magical Spell in the Countryside’ which contains [[Robin Davies]]' last recorded comments about the series that made him a star and about his special friendship with Catweazle co-star [[Geoffrey Bayldon]]. The [[DVD]] image gallery also recorded the occasion of their last meeting at an annual commemorative event held at the [[farm]] in [[East Clandon]], [[Surrey]], where the first series was filmed in the summer of 1969.

Also featured in the article was an interview with creator [[Richard Carpenter (screenwriter)|Richard 'Kip' Carpenter]] in which he gave a frank account of his thoughts on modern television and expressed his desire to bring his writing career full-circle with a Catweazle movie for the 21st century. He also confirmed that he had drafted a new script.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.paulpert.com/catweazlepage5.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations for a movie had reached [[pre-production]] stages, when on 26 February 2012, [[Richard Carpenter (screenwriter)|Richard Carpenter]] died whilst out walking his dog in the countryside at the age of 82.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2012/mar/05/richard-carpenter&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/richard-carpenter-actor-and-writer-famed-for-catweazleand-the-ghosts-of-motley-hall-7547338.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
There are two [[novelisation]]s by Carpenter, one for each series: ''Catweazle'' and ''Catweazle and the Magic Zodiac''. A 20-page picture book, ''Catweazle in Marrow Escape'' was also produced, written by Alan Fennell. A comic strip version featured in the TV comic ''[[Look-In]]'', written by [[Angus P. Allan]], and three annuals were also released by World, from 1970 to 1972.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Anyone, whether directly involved or not, may add evidence to this page. Please choose an appropriate header for your evidence and sign your comments with your name.

It is extremely important in order that your submitted evidence be considered by the Arbitrators that when you cite evidence to provide a link to the exact edit which displays the transaction, links to the page itself are not sufficient. For example, to cite the edit by Mennonot to the article Anomalous phenomenon adding a link to Hundredth Monkey use this form: &lt;nowiki&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Anomalous_phenomenon&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=5584644]&lt;/nowiki&gt; [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Anomalous_phenomenon&amp;diff=0&amp;oldid=5584644].

This page is not for general discussion - for that, see [[Wikipedia talk:{{PAGENAME}}|talk page]]. 

If you disagree with some evidence you see here, please provide counter-evidence, or an explanation of why the evidence is misleading. Please do this under a seperate header, to seperate your response from the original evidence.

Be aware that the Arbitrators may at times rework this page to try to make it more coherent. If you are a participant in the case or a third party, please don't try to refactor the page, let the Arbitrators do it. If you object to evidence which is inserted by other participants or third parties please voice your objections on the talk page. It is especially important to not remove evidence presented by others.

==Bryan's participation==

I'm the one who stepped in and protected [[Project for a New American Century]] a month ago when the edit war this request is based on was occurring, and I stuck around in the article's talk page attempting to help work out the dispute as an &quot;outsider&quot; who didn't know much about the subject. I eventually wound up joining the arbitration request (at the time the request page had the following guideline on it: &quot;Users may join in the Complaint by seconding the Complaint or elaborating on it, but by doing so they implicitly respresent that they wish to be a party to the case and are thus subject to counterclaims which they may have to respond to.&quot; This has since been removed, so I have no idea what my status is any more). Anyway, I tried to start a survey, and kept a running commentary of how I felt it was going. It's wound up at [[Wikipedia talk:Requests for arbitration/VeryVerily]], having been moved around a lot in various reorganizations of the RfA pages. The survey itself is at [[Talk:Project for the New American Century/Survey]] and the discussion of what questions would be on the survey was moved to [[Talk:Project for the New American Century/Survey/Archive]] when it started. I feel that VeryVerily did whatever he could to sabotage the survey; he spent the time leading up to the survey complaining that the questions were &quot;fraudulent&quot; without adequately explaining why or providing any useful suggestions for questions of his own (here's the questions he did propose: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Talk%3AProject_for_the_New_American_Century%2FSurvey&amp;diff=6318120&amp;oldid=6318042]), and then once the survey was running he repeatedly inserted lots of non-vote complaints into the voting sections in direct contravention of the survey guidelines (this history range covers the low-intensity edit war that ensued as I tried to keep moving his comments down into the &quot;discussion&quot; section of the survey: [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Talk:Project+for+the+New+American+Century/Survey&amp;action=history&amp;limit=85&amp;offset=85]).

:Apparently VV was unimpressed by the results of the survey.  He continues to force his version without discussion or taking other opinions into account.

== Case closed? ==

(copied from main discussion page, in case that's being ignored [[User:VeryVerily|Very]][[User talk:VeryVerily|&lt;font color=green&gt;Verily&lt;/font&gt;]] 10:13, 18 Nov 2004 (UTC))

Can we be done with this?  The situation has ''looong'' since sorted itself out.  With the help of other editors, we worked it all out and all is well and settled.  As I stated at the outset, it was premature to bug a mediator over a content conflict barely four days old, it was absurdly premature to drag this to arbitration only days later, and it was absurd to accept it on the grounds that I believed it was premature to bug a mediator.  These content disputes usually sort themselves out after due time and due attention.  Let's shut this case down, it's a big enough distraction having to deal with the other one.

Arbitrators should vote for or against each point or vote to abstain. 
*Only items that receive a majority aye vote will be enacted. 
*Items that receive a majority nay vote will be formally rejected. 
*Items that do not receive a majority aye or nay vote will be open to possible amendment by any Arbitrator if he so chooses. After the amendment process is complete, the item will be voted on one last time. 
*Items that receive a majority abstentions will need to go through an amendment process and be re-voted on once. 

Conditional votes for, against, or to abstain should be explained by the Arbitrator in parenthesis after his time-stamped signature. For example, an Arbitrator can state that he would only favor a particular remedy based on whether or not another remedy/remedies were enacted.

'''Kathryn Johanna Kuhlman''' (May 9, 1907&amp;nbsp;– February 20, 1976) was an American [[faith healer]] and [[evangelism|evangelist]].

==Personal life==
Kathryn Johanna Kuhlman was born in [[Concordia, Missouri]], to [[Ethnic German|German]]-American parents.&lt;ref name=obitNY&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10B12F63C5511718DDDAB0A94DA405B868BF1D3 | title=Kathryn Kuhlman, Evangelist And Faith Healer, Dies in Tulsa | publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=February 22, 1976 | first= /Gary| last=  Settle| accessdate =2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was &quot;[[born-again]]&quot; at the age of 14 in the [[Methodist Church]] of Concordia, and began preaching in the West at the age of sixteen in primarily [[Baptist]] Churches.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

In 1935, Kathryn met Burroughs Waltrip, a Texas evangelist who was eight years her senior. Shortly after his visit to Denver, Waltrip divorced his wife, left his family and moved to Mason City, Iowa, where he began a revival center called Radio Chapel. Kathryn and her friend and pianist Helen Gulliford came into town to help him raise funds for his ministry. It was shortly after their arrival that the romance between Burroughs and Kathryn became publicly known.

Burroughs and Kathryn decided to wed. While discussing the matter with some friends, Kathryn had said that she could not “find the will of God in the matter.” These and other friends encouraged her not to go through with the marriage, but Kathryn justified it to herself and others by believing that Waltrip’s wife had left him, not the other way around. On October 18, 1938, Kathryn secretly married “Mister,” as she liked to call Waltrip, in Mason City. The wedding did not give her new peace about their union, however. After they checked into their hotel that night, Kathryn left and drove over to the hotel where Helen was staying with another friend. She sat with them weeping and admitted that the marriage was a mistake. No one seems to know exactly when the separation took place. In a 1952 interview with the Denver Post she (Kathryn) said, &quot;He charged—correctly—that I refused to live with him. And I haven't seen him in eight years.&quot;  That would put the separation in 1944—which is probably accurate.  This means they lived together for the better part of six years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Buckingham, J. (1976) Daughter of destiny: Kathryn Kuhlman...Her story. Plainfield, New Jersey: Logos International, p. 82 ISBN 0-88270-784-1&lt;/ref&gt; She was divorced by Burroughs Waltrip in 1948.

==Career==
Kuhlman traveled extensively around the [[United States]] and in many other countries holding &quot;healing crusades&quot; between the 1940s and 1970s. She had a weekly [[TV program]] in the 1960s and 1970s called ''I Believe In Miracles'' that was aired nationally. The foundation was established in 1954, and its [[Canada|Canadian]] branch in 1970.

Following a 1967 fellowship in Philadelphia, Dr. [[William A. Nolen]] conducted a case study of 23 people who claimed to have been cured during her services.&lt;ref name=&quot;NoHealing&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newspaperarchive.com/newspapers1/na0030/5967824/21003862_clean.html | title=Psychic Healing?

One woman who was said to have been cured of spinal cancer threw away her brace and ran across the stage at Kuhlman's command; her spine collapsed the next day, according to Nolen, and she died four months later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pittsburgh1975&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cOQNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iG0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5291,834959&amp;dq=kathryn+kuhlman+william+nolen  | title=Inside Religion: Kuhlman Tested By MD's Probe | publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=November 8, 1975 | first=[[Lester Kinsolving]] | last= | accessdate =2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4vMNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TnkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5343,1149932&amp;dq=kathryn+kuhlman | title=A follow-up study of 23 patients 'cured' in a Kathryn Kuhlman service | publisher=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |date=November 2, 1974 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-11-12}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuhlman&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Randi | first = James | authorlink = James Randi | year = 1989 | title = [[The Faith Healers]] | publisher = Prometheus Books | id = ISBN 0-87975-535-0 p. 228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 Ph.D. H. Richard Casdorph M.D., a medical doctor and researcher followed up and investigated a number of Kuhlman's ( and several other) Healings contacting their physicians and carefully examining related medical reports and X-rays.Casdorph and in 1976 published his findings in a book which also includes photos of XRAYS entitled; THE MIRACLES Publisher: Logos International; 1st edition (1976) ISBN  978-0882701714; also see his website; http://www.is-there-a-god.info/life/tenhealings.shtml

By 1970 she moved to Los Angeles conducting faith healing for thousands of people each day as an heir to [[Aimee Semple McPherson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuhlman1970&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newspaperarchive.com/newspapers1/na0021/6793856/47241589_clean.html | title=Aimee Macpherson has a Dazzling Successor | publisher=[[Pasadena Star-News]] |date=July 4, 1970 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became well-known despite, as she told reporters, having no theological training.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuhlman1970&quot;/&gt;

In 1975, Kuhlman was sued by Paul Bartholomew, her personal administrator, who claimed that she kept $1 million in jewelry and $1 million in fine art hidden away and sued her for $430,500 for breach of contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/120169428.html?dids=120169428:120169428&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=JUL+18%2C+1975&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=Evangelist+Sued+By+a+Former+Aide&amp;pqatl=google | title=Evangelist Sued By a Former Aide | publisher=[[Washington Post]] |date=July 18, 1975 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/662183362.html?dids=662183362:662183362&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Jul+03%2C+1975&amp;author=RUSSELL+CHANDLER&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Ex-Aides+Sue+Kathryn+Kuhlman&amp;pqatl=google |title=Ex-Aides Sue Kathryn Kuhlman | publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=July 3, 1975 | first= Russell| last=  Chandler| accessdate =2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two former associates accused her in the lawsuit of diverting funds and of illegally removing records, which she denied and said the records were not private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wOgNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=onkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5546,2534488&amp;dq=kathryn+kuhlman | title=Kathryn Kuhlman Sued By Former Associates | publisher=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |date=July 12, 1975 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-11-12}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kuhlman, the lawsuit was settled prior to trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pittsburgh1975&quot;/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
In July 1975 her doctor diagnosed her with a minor heart flareup and she had a relapse in November while in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=ObitPittsburgh&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newspaperarchive.com/newspapers1/na0034/6776963/33852475_clean.html | title=Kathryn Kuhlman Is Dead  | publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=February 21, 1976 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-11-12}}{{Dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, she had open heart surgery in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] from which she died in February 1976.&lt;ref name=obitNY/&gt; Kathryn Kuhlman is interred in the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Glendale, California]]. A plaque in her honor is located in the main city park in Concordia, Missouri, a town located in central Missouri on Interstate Highway 70.

After she died, her [[Will (law)|will]] led to controversy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bequests1976&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.newspaperarchive.com/newspapers1/na0023/6792967/46427475_clean.html | title=Kuhlman Bequests Listed | publisher=[[Independent Press-Telegram]] |date=April 17, 1976

She influenced [[faith healers]] [[Benny Hinn]] and [[Billy Burke (evangelist)|Billy Burke]]. Hinn has adopted some of her techniques and wrote a book about her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.csicop.org/si/2002-05/i-files.html | title=Benny Hinn: Healer or Hypnotist? | publisher=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=May/June 2002  | first=Joe | last=Nickell  | accessdate =2007-11-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071012200735/http://www.csicop.org/si/2002-05/i-files.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 [[David Byrne]] and [[Brian Eno]] sampled one of Kuhlman's sermons in their album ''[[My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (album)|My Life in the Bush of Ghosts]]''.  The track was entitled &quot;The Spirit Womb,&quot; a mis-hearing of Kuhlman's actual utterance &quot;the spirit world.&quot;  When Kuhlman's estate refused to license the use of her voice, the track was re-recorded as &quot;[[The Jezebel Spirit]]&quot; with an unidentified exorcist's vocal replacing Kuhlman's.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duke UP - 14 March 2011 - McLeod and DiCola - Creative License: The Law and Culture of Digital Sampling&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Kembrew McLeod]] and [[Peter DiCola]]|title=Creative License: The Law and Culture of Digital Sampling|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|date=14 March 2011|pages=167|isbn=9780822348757|url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=nOWdriHLHgQC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=%22The+Jezebel+Spirit%22+Byrne&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=smX0Us6tMcnOkgWazIHQCg&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20Jezebel%20Spirit%22%20Byrne&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original Kuhlman-vocal has been released on a bootleg but not officially.

==Healing==
Many accounts of healings were published in her books, which were &quot;[[ghostwriter|ghost-written]]&quot; by author [[Jamie Buckingham]] of Florida, including her autobiography, which was dictated at a hotel in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]].&lt;ref&gt;Buckingham, J. (1976) Daughter of destiny: Kathryn Kuhlman...Her story. Plainfield, New Jersey: Logos International, p 167 ISBN 0-88270-784-1&lt;/ref&gt; Buckingham also wrote his own Kuhlman  biography that presented an unvarnished account of her life.&lt;ref&gt;Buckingham, J. (1976) Daughter of destiny: Kathryn Kuhlman...Her story. Plainfield, New Jersey: Logos International ISBN 0-88270-784-1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
For several decades there has been serious debate regarding the authenticity of Kathryn Kuhlman's ministry. Some would suggest that she was a modern day [[prophet]] exercising the power of God, whereas others would suggest that she was a [[false prophet]], exercising a &quot;spirit&quot; that masqueraded as God. 
The debate continues today with many believers upholding Kuhlman as an important forerunner (including proponents of the &quot;[[Prosperity Theology]]&quot; &amp; &quot;[[Faith Healing]]&quot; movement, such as [[Benny Hinn]]), and with some Christian cessationist apologists, such as&lt;ref&gt;[[Counterfeit Revival]] Hannegraaff, Hank (1997) Word Publishing ISBN 0-8499-1182-6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hank Hanegraaff]] of the [[Christian Research Institute]], considering Kuhlman to be an influential forerunner of a false Christianity that robs people of their money and propagates a distorted substitute of true Christian teachings.

[[Image:Rossa-Maria Piłsudska.JPG|thumb|300px|Grave of Maria Piłsudska at the [[Rossa Cemetery]] in [[Vilnius]]]]

'''Maria Piłsudska''', [[née]] Koplewska (1865 – 17 August 1921), was the first wife of [[Poland]]'s [[Marshal of Poland|Marshal]] [[Józef Piłsudski]] and ostensibly the [[first lady]] of Poland during most of his service as Poland's [[list of Presidents of Poland|Chief of State]].

== Life ==
She was born in 1865 in [[Zalavas]] (now part of [[Vilnius County]]), at that time part of the [[Russian Empire]], to Konstanty Koplewski, a prominent physician. After graduating from high school, she moved to [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]].  There she studied in the [[Bestuzhev Courses]], a university for women, while cultivating friendships within certain revolutionary circles.  It was there she met Marian Juszkiewicz, a young [[railway]] engineer whom she married in 1883. Their marriage was not a happy one, however, and fell apart soon after the birth of their daughter, Wanda, in 1887.

In 1892, the beautiful, intelligent and socially poised Maria met [[Józef Piłsudski]]. After seven years, they married on July 15, 1899, at the village of [[Paproć Duża]] near [[Łomża]]. Since Maria was a divorcee and the Catholic Church did not recognize divorce, she and Piłsudski had converted to [[Protestantism]]. Soon afterward they settled in [[Łódź]], where Józef continued his revolutionary activities.  In February 1900, they were arrested when a clandestine printing press was discovered in their apartment.  After eleven months Maria was released, while Piłsudski remained imprisoned in the infamous Tenth Pavilion at the [[Warsaw Citadel]] in the Russian-occupied part of Poland.  Upon his subsequent escape from a mental hospital in St. Petersburg to which he had been transferred, the couple moved to [[Lwów]], in eastern [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] in [[Austria-Hungary]].

In mid-November 1901, they relocated to [[London]], the seat of the Polish Socialist Party's leadership. In April 1902, however, pursuant to the needs of the PPS, they returned to Lwów, and in 1904 moved to [[Kraków]].

In May 1906 Piłsudski met [[Aleksandra Piłsudska|Aleksandra Szczerbińska]], who was working with the PPS paramilitary organization.  After a time, Piłsudski and Aleksandra began an affair.  In 1908 Maria Piłsudska's daughter by her first marriage, Wanda, died. By 1909, Maria was aware of Jozef's affair but refused to divorce him, and they continued to share a home until the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. Maria remained popular among the PPS and its paramilitary faction, and had helped Józef gain adherents amongst them. Their marriage continued to deteriorate, however, and after his release from [[Magdeburg]] Prison in November 1918, Piłsudski abandoned her. Aleksandra Szczerbińska became his de facto wife, although for propriety's sake they had to maintain separate homes. Maria Piłsudska withdrew from public life and continued to reside in Kraków.

Maria Piłsudska died in Kraków on August 17, 1921. She was buried at the [[Rossa Cemetery]] in [[Vilnius]]. Piłsudski did not attend the funeral; two months later he married Aleksandra, by whom he had had a daughter, [[Wanda Piłsudska|Wanda]], in 1918, and a second daughter, [[Jadwiga Piłsudska|Jadwiga]], in 1920.

* '''Delete''', what's next? Wiki articles for each and every high school student? --[[User:Nought|Nought]] 23:20, 31 Oct 2004 (UTC)
* '''Delete''', not notable and likely not even verifiable. Perhaps we need a rule that if you can't use wiki-formatting, it's a speedy delete candidate too, reading that is painful. [[User:ShaneKing|Shane King]] 23:33, Oct 31, 2004 (UTC)
* I have '''Merged-and-prepared-for-Redirect''' to [[Conroe, Texas]]. Let the people who know and care about Conroe, Texas and its schools sort it out. (If nobody reads the Rambot article, then there's no harm in having it contain a school description that nobody reads...) If that's not acceptable, my vote is '''Delete:''' vanity, and no potential to become encyclopedic. Nov 2004 (UTC)
[[User:Dpbsmith|[[User:Dpbsmith|Dpbsmith]] [[User_talk:dpbsmith|(talk)]]]] 00:33, 1 Nov 2004 (UTC)
** '''Comment''' I think you should refrain from messing up the article while its up for a vote.  People are not voting on a redirect, they are voting on an article and how are they to judge the article if your redirect is there now instead? --[[User:ShaunMacPherson|ShaunMacPherson]] 03:14, 2 
*** By looking at the history, of course. Editing articles on VfD is not only OK, it's virtuous (provided the VfD notice isn't removed). If by any chance you're not aware of the article history feature and how it works, as a VfD participant it would be a good idea for you to familiarize yourself with it. VfD debates are not really about decisions to delete an article's content; the reason why we make a big deal about them and discuss them for five days is that they are decisions to delete an article's history. When an article is deleted, ordinary users can no longer view the history. [[User:Dpbsmith|[[User:Dpbsmith|Dpbsmith]] [[User_talk:dpbsmith|(talk)]]]] 13:53, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)

'''Walcha'''  (pronounced &quot;wolka&quot;) is a parish and town at the south-eastern edge of the [[Northern Tablelands (New South Wales)|Northern Tablelands, New South Wales]], [[Australia]].

The town serves as the seat of [[Walcha Shire]].  Walcha is located 425 kilometres by road from Sydney at the intersection of the [[Oxley Highway]] and [[Thunderbolts Way]]. The [[Apsley River (New South Wales)|Apsley River]] passes through the town to tumble over the [[Apsley Falls]] before joining the [[Macleay River]] further on. Originally the river caused flooding in the town prior to a [[levee]] bank being constructed and saving the town from more floods. At the 2006 [[Census in Australia|census]], Walcha had a population of 1,623 people.&lt;ref name=Census2006Y /&gt;

The [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|Main North railway line]] is located some distance away, at a separate village called [[Walcha Road, New South Wales|Walcha Road]] which serves as the railhead. This is served by the daily [[NSW TrainLink]] Xplorer service between [[Sydney]] and [[Armidale, New South Wales|Armidale]]. The railway line was built at Walcha Road, because it was the closest point they could get to the town, due to the steep climb over the [[Great Dividing Range]].

==History==
The area is thought to have been occupied by the Strange Days people [[Australian Aborigines|Aborigine]]s prior to [[Europe]]an settlement. In 1818, [[Nick Clifford]] became the first white person to discover the area and the falls which were later to be named [[Strange Days Falls]].  

Hamilton Collins Sempill was the first settler in the [[New England (Australia)|New England]] area when he took up the 'Wolka' run in 1832, establishing slab huts where 'Langford' now stands. Other early runs around the district were Bergen-op-Zoom (1834), Ohio (1836), Europambela (c.1836), Surveyor’s Creek (1836), Emu Creek (c.1837), Ingalba (1837), Orandumbie (1837), Tiara (1837) and Winterbourne (1837). A severe depression from 1841 to 1843, and low demand for wool created hardship for many of these early settlers. In 1848 Walcha run is recorded as being {{convert|64000|acre|km2}} and in the lease of David Lanarch. During 1854 Walcha was sold to Rundle and Dangar who held the mortgage for Jamison and Connal.&lt;ref&gt;Donald, J.Kay, Exploring the North Coast and New England, Kangaroo Press, Kenthurst, 1978, ISBN 0-86417-121-8&lt;/ref&gt; Later John Fletcher acquired Walcha and moved from Branga Plains to Oorundumby. After being sold in 1905, Oorundumby was resumed for soldier settlement in 1947 and subdivided into 22 holdings.

A ‘[[wool]]’ road to Port Macquarie (the Oxley Highway) was under construction in 1842 for the transportation of wool from New England to the coast.Walcha Post Office opened on 1 July 1850.&lt;ref name = &quot;Post Office&quot;&gt;{{Cite web  | last = Premier Postal History  | title = Post Office List  | publisher = Premier Postal Auctions | url = https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=NSW&amp;country= | accessdate = 2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mail arrived from Macdonald River (now [[Bendemeer, New South Wales|Bendemeer]]). Walcha was gazetted as a village site in 1852, when town allotments were sold, with annual sales following. At that time there was a blacksmith's shop, a general store and a flour mill. A Roman Catholic chapel was erected in 1854, a police station and the first Presbyterian church was built in 1857 and the Walcha National School in 1859.

In 1861 the population was recorded at 355 and the Anglican church was built in 1862 of stone taken from the demolished homestead, 'Villa Walcha', erected on the Wolka run in the 1840s. The old church has fine stained-glass windows which bear tribute to some of the town's pioneers.

The population dropped in the 1860s but the town soon began to grow for two reasons: firstly, [[Toona australis|red cedar]] getters were active in the area's rainforests by about 1870.  [[Gold]] was discovered near Walcha in the 1870s at Glen Morrison, [[Tia, New South Wales|Tia]], The Cells River and [[Nowendoc, New South Wales|Nowendoc]]. [[Antimony]], [[copper]], [[graphite]], [[manganese]], [[silver]] and high quality [[slate]] was also mined in the district.

On 5 April 1878 Walcha was proclaimed a town, when it was gazetted, the boundaries defined and a courthouse was built. A rail link to Sydney and Uralla opened at Walcha Road in 1882. The town became a municipality in 1889. On 19 March 1890 the Walcha Pastoral &amp; Agricultural Association was formed. This annual show has excellent exhibits of [[livestock]], produce, [[vegetable]]s, flowers, wool and handicrafts. Walcha Cottage Hospital founded in 1890 and was situated on the southern hill in South Street. The Shire of Apsley was constituted by proclamation on 7 March 1906. It is in the counties of [[Vernon County, New South Wales|Vernon]], [[Hawes County, New South Wales|Hawes]], and [[Inglis County, New South Wales|Inglis]] and comprises about 60 parishes. The area is {{convert|1605590|acre|km2}}. The Shire of Walcha was constituted by the Union of the Municipality and the Shire of Apsley as from on 1 June 1955.

Other district villages are: [[Niangala, New South Wales|Niangala]], [[Nowendoc, New South Wales|Nowendoc]] and part of [[Woolbrook, New South Wales|Woolbrook]] with settlements at [[Brackendale, New South Wales|Brackendale]], Glen Morrison, Ingalba, [[Tia, New South Wales|Tia]] and [[Yarrowitch, New South Wales|Yarrowitch]].

History was made at Walcha in 1950 when a [[Tiger Moth]] was the first aircraft used to spread [[superphosphate]] by air in Australia. The ‘super’ was dropped on ''Mirani'' and other landholders soon followed suit to greatly increase the [[livestock]] carrying capacity of the district.

In 1992 the Walcha Telecottage was established to become the first telecentre established in Australia. The Telecottage is a not for profit community with the latest information communication facilities, in order to activate interactions between the local communities and to create employment opportunities. This Telecottage carries out not only the fundamental types of work such as job training, remote education, secretarial service and data analysis, but also Internet access service for individuals and small companies. Walcha Telecottage produces a weekly community newsletter, the Apsley Advocate, which is free and delivered to over 1,600 commercial and private addresses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://andrewhunter.com/afh.htm Andrew Hunter] Retrieved on 23 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2008 Walcha recorded one of the state's highest rises in property values at 20 per cent over the last 5 years, according to a report from Australian Property Monitors.&lt;ref&gt;Walcha News, Walcha Property Amongst the Best in NSW, 15 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''USS ''S-34'' (SS-139)''' was an [[United States S class submarine|''S''-class submarine]] of the [[United States Navy]].

''S-34'' was laid down on 28 May 1918 by the [[Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], California. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 13 February 1919 sponsored by Miss Florence Hellman, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 12 July 1922 with Lieutenant Elroy L. Vanderkloot in command.

==Service history==
[[Image:S-34 Launch.JPG|left|thumb|The launching of ''S-34'' on 13 February 1919.]]
Following commissioning, ''S-34'' was ordered to [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], Connecticut, for engineering alterations by the prime contractor, the [[Electric Boat]] Company. Decommissioned on 25 October 1922, she was delivered to the company which completed the work in the spring of 1923. The [[submarine]] was recommissioned on 23 April; and, after further trials and various exercises off the East Coast and in the [[Caribbean Sea]], she returned to the West Coast, arriving at [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], California, her home port, on 6 August. For the next year and one-half, she remained based in southern [[California]], then, in 1925, she was ordered to the [[Philippines]]. She departed from [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], California, in mid-April, arrived at the Submarine Base, [[Cavite]], P.I., on 12 July; and, after voyage repairs and an overhaul, commenced operations as a unit of the [[Asiatic Fleet]]. From then until 1932, she rotated between exercises, patrols, and overhauls in the Philippines during the winter and deployments to the [[China]] coast in the summer for operations out of [[Qingdao|Tsingtao]]. In 1932, she was ordered back to the eastern [[Pacific Ocean]]. She departed [[Manila]] on 2 May and headed for [[Pearl Harbor]], whence she operated until April 1941. She then returned to San Diego.

During the remaining months of peace, ''S-34'' provided services for the West Coast Sound School. With the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], defensive patrol work off the West Coast was added to her duties. However, with the new year, 1942, she and other [[World War I]] design submarines were ordered prepared for service in the northern Pacific in defense of the [[Aleutian Islands]]. She underwent overhaul at [[Mare Island]], and, in March, she moved north to the newly established submarine base at [[Dutch Harbor]], [[Unalaska]]. On 12 April, she headed west on her first war patrol.

===First war patrol===
One day out, a heavy wave threw the quartermaster of the watch against the side of the bridge, and ''S-34'' was forced to return to base to put the badly injured man ashore. Arriving on 14 April, she cleared the harbor again the same day and resumed her westward passage. On 15 April, engineering casualties and poor weather slowed her progress. The next day, the weather moderated, but intensified again on 18 April. On 20 April, she left the [[Bering Sea]] and entered the less violent, but fog shrouded, waters of the [[Kuril Islands]]. Two days later, off the entrance to [[Onekotan Strait]] she attacked her first enemy target, but failed to score.

The next day, ''S-34'' moved into the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] to take up her assigned station west of [[Paramushiro]]. Ice, two to five feet above the water, still covered the area and the boat retired through the strait to patrol on the Pacific side of the island.

24 April brought another unsuccessful attack on a merchantman and an attempt to close a warship. Two days later, the lookouts observed increased activity by enemy patrol planes. On 27 April, the [[United States S class submarine|S-boat]] again attempted to penetrate the ice, via [[Mushiru Strait]]. The same day, she returned to the Pacific; and, on 28 April she headed back to the Aleutians.

She encountered mountainous seas in the Bering Sea; but by 1 May, she was at [[Attu Island]]. Thence, she continued on to [[Kiska]]; remained offshore on 2 May as a storm battered the island; and, on 3 May, she replenished and moved north to intercept any enemy submarines which might be heading for the [[Gulf of Alaska]]. On 10 May, she returned to Dutch Harbor.

Refit as intelligence estimates predicting a Japanese thrust at [[Midway Island]] and the Aleutians were received, ''S-34'' cleared Dutch Harbor on 28 May and stood west to patrol north of Attu. On 29 May, the Japanese Aleutian force sortied from [[Ominato]] and headed east, its approach to its target covered by fog and rain. On the morning of 3 June, Japanese planes bombed Dutch Harbor.

===Second war patrol===

From the start of her patrol until 11 June, ''S-34'' remained in her assigned area, listening to reports, but sighting no enemy ships. On 11 June, she received news of the Japanese occupation of Kiska and orders to take &quot;maximum offensive action.&quot; She headed for Kiska.

Diverted back to Dutch Harbor, she replenished on 12 June and got underway again the same day, but returned to Attu instead of going to Kiska. She reconnoitered [[Sarana Bay]], [[Holtz Bay]], and [[Chichagof Harbor]]; none showed any activity. On 17 June, she sighted a warship off the [[Semichi Islands]], but could not close the range. She then returned to Attu and, on 20 June, sighted an enemy [[destroyer]] patrolling off Sarana Bay. Between 07:00 and 10:00, she sighted and lost the target twice as it moved in and out of the fog.

At 11:55, she sighted a large tanker inside the bay. Fifty minutes later, she slipped past a destroyer guarding the entrance and began maneuvering into the bay. Her target was engaged in refueling another destroyer. At 13:50, ''S-34'' grounded at a depth of 48&amp;nbsp;feet. Run up to 25&amp;nbsp;feet, she came out of the water to the waterline; then backed off into deep water. Within five minutes, she was operating at periscope depth. The fueling destroyer had gotten underway from alongside the tanker and was racing across the intervening waters. ''S-34'' fired two [[torpedo]]es at the destroyer, forcing the enemy to swerve and pass down the submarine's port side. Unable then to bring her tubes to bear on the tanker, the S-boat swung right to avoid [[depth charge]]s. At 14:03, she bottomed in 164&amp;nbsp;feet, just inside the entrance to the bay, where she remained until 23:30.

During that time, only one destroyer was heard searching for her, the other, which had conducted the high speed attack, was heard pinging from the same spot for nine hours. She had presumably grounded after the attack, but, by 23:00, the tide had risen and she had moved to join in the search for the submarine.

At 23:30, ''S-34'' began to make her way out of the bay. Twenty minutes later, one of the destroyers located her. The pace of the hunt was stepped up, but the quarry evaded attempts to destroy her. By 02:30 on 21 June, she had maneuvered out of the bay, lost her pursuer; and set a course for Dutch Harbor. On 26 June, ''S-34'' moored in Dutch Harbor, whence she proceeded to [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]], Washington, for overhaul and training duty.

===Third war patrol===

On 13 September, she returned to Unalaska, and, on 14 September, she departed from Dutch Harbor on her third war patrol. Two days later, she crossed the 180th meridian; and, on 17 September, she arrived in the [[Semichi]] area and commenced crossing the Japanese supply lanes to the western Aleutians in search of targets. On 20 September, while off [[Buldir]], her after radio mast was partially carried away by heavy seas and threatened to foul the propellers and stern planes. Despite the heavy seas, Chief Machinist's Mate B.F. Allen went over the side; cut the wreckage adrift and rigged two forward wing antennas.

On 21 September, the submarine resumed her patrol off Attu, reconnoitering the approaches to its harbors. On 26 September, she was ordered to Kiska, and, on the afternoon of 28 September, she sighted a [[minelayer]] off [[Kiska Harbor]]. The enemy, however, detected her presence before she could close the target. Destroyers joined the minelayer, and ''S-34'' once again became the hunted. Forty minutes and 47 depth charges later, she cleared the immediate area. A week later, she sighted and closed a Kiska-bound enemy submarine; but, as the torpedoes were readied, depth control was lost; and she failed to score. On 8 October, she headed home, arriving at Dutch Harbor on 11 October.

===Fourth war patrol===

Storms and heavy seas abounded in the western Aleutians during ''S-34''’s fourth war patrol, 23 October to 21 November. Operating in and across the Japanese traffic routes from Kiska to [[Agattu]] and Attu and between Paramushiro and Attu, she sighted only one possible target, a submarine which disappeared before identification could be made.

===Fifth war patrol===

She got underway for her fifth war patrol on 5 December. On 9 December, she resumed operations to intercept Japanese shipping between the Kurils and the Aleutians. Twenty days later, she returned to Dutch Harbor.

===Overhaul===

In early January 1943, the S-boat sailed south. On 18 January, she arrived at San Diego where she remained until late April, undergoing overhaul; receiving radar, air conditioning, and improved communication and navigation equipment, and providing services to the West Coast Sound School. On 10 May, she returned to Dutch Harbor; and, on 13 May, she departed from that base to patrol again in the Kurils.

===Sixth war patrol===

By 22 May, ''S-34'' was off Paramushiro and, for the next 12 days, she patrolled in the southern approaches to the island, and in Shumushu and Paramushiro strait. On the evening of the ninth day, she torpedoed and sank a small freighter off [[Torishimo Retto]]; and, on the evening of 3 June, she cleared the area.

===Seventh war patrol===

Arriving back at Dutch Harbor on 10 June, she departed again 11 days later. On 28 June, she approached the fog-bound Kurils; and, on 1 July, she moved toward the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] to locate and destroy enemy fishing vessels operating near and north of [[Cape Lopatka]]. On 3 July, while she was charging, fire broke out in the port motor, but was quickly extinguished. Repairs were completed on 5 July; and, on 7 July, she moved into a new area, [[Onekotan Island]]. The next day, she returned to Paramushiro. On 13 July, she sighted two ships and commenced closing the targets despite poor visibility. Shortly after noon, she launched three torpedoes, but her crew heard only thuds as they struck the target. On 15 July, she moved back into [[Paramushiro Strait]] and, on 22 July set a course for Unalaska.

==Retirement==
Arriving on 30 July, she moved south in early August and, at mid-month, arrived at San Diego where she provided training services through the end of World War II. Then ordered inactivated, she proceeded to San Francisco where she was decommissioned on 23 October 1945. Her name was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] the following month, and her hulk was sold for scrapping in 1946.

''S-34'' received one [[battle star]] for her [[World War II]] service.

'''John Egerton, 2nd Earl of Bridgewater''' [[Privy Council of England|PC]] (30 May 1623 &amp;ndash; 26 October 1686) was an [[England|English]] nobleman.

He was a son of [[John Egerton, 1st Earl of Bridgewater]] and his wife Lady Frances Stanley. His maternal grandparents were [[Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby]] and his wife Alice Spencer.

According to the [[Will of King Henry VIII]], his mother, at one time, was second-in-line to inherit England's throne.  However, Lady Frances Stanley's older sister, [[Anne Stanley, Countess of Castlehaven]], was passed over for King [[James VI of Scotland]].

He served as [[Lord Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire]] (1660&amp;ndash;1686), [[Lord Lieutenant of Cheshire|Cheshire]] (1670&amp;ndash;1676), [[Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire|Lancashire]] (1670&amp;ndash;1676), and [[Hertfordshire]] (1681&amp;ndash;1686), in addition to being invested as a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]lor in 1679.  He was buried in [[Little Gaddesden]], [[Hertfordshire]].

In 1641 he married to [[Elizabeth Egerton|Elizabeth Cavendish]] (1626–1663), a daughter of [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle]] and his first wife Elizabeth Basset. They had four children:

*[[John Egerton, 3rd Earl of Bridgewater]] (9 November 1646 - 19 March 1701).
*William Egerton (born 15 August 1649). He married Honora Leigh.
*Thomas Egerton of [[Tatton Park]].
*Elizabeth Egerton (24 August 1653 - 1709). Married [[Robert Sidney, 4th Earl of Leicester]].

'''Dehomag''' was a [[Germany|German]] subsidiary of [[IBM]] with monopoly in the German market before and during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=IBM&gt;[http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/Holocaust/black.html Edwin Black on IBM and the Holocaust]&lt;/ref&gt; The word was an acronym for ''Deutsche Hollerith-Maschinen Gesellschaft mbH'' ({{lang-en|German Hollerith Machines LLC}}). ''Hollerith'' refers to the German-American inventor of the technology of [[punched card]]s, [[Herman Hollerith]].

Under [[Nazi Germany]], Dehomag leased and maintained the Nazis' collection of card punch machines. The use of this technology increased the efficiency of the [[Final Solution]]. IBM in New York established a special subsidiary, Watson Business Machines, to deal with railway traffic in the [[General Government]] during [[the Holocaust in Poland]]. The German Transport Ministry used IBM machines under the New York-controlled subsidiary in Warsaw, not the German subsidiary. Dehomag general manager for Germany, Hermann Rottke, reported to Thomas J. Watson in New York. It was legal for IBM to service the [[Third Reich]] directly, but only until America entered the war in December 1941.

The technology of punched cards dates back at least [[punched card#History|to the 18th century]] when it was used for mass production of woven textiles and later used as a recording and play back system in player pianos. The use of punched cards for recording and tabulating data was first proposed and used by [[Semen Korsakov]] in or about 1805. In 1832 [[Charles Babbage]] proposed using similar cards to program and store computation by his calculating engine. Punch card technology was further developed for tabulating and data processing purposes by [[Herman Hollerith]], dated back to the 1880s. It was used for the [[1890 United States Census]] and for the [[census|census work]] of several foreign governments. [[Willy Heidinger]], an acquaintance of Hollerith, licensed all of Hollerith’s patents in 1910, and created Dehomag in Germany. In 1911 Hollerith's company merged with several others, forming [[Computing Tabulating Recording Company]] (CTR).  In 1923 CTR acquired 90% ownership of Dehomag, thus acquiring patents developed by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aspray (ed.) |first = William | title = Computing Before Computers |publisher = Iowa State University Press | year = 1990 |isbn = 0-8138-0047-1 |page = 137}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 CTR was [[History of IBM|renamed IBM]].

In the following years, Dehomag, obeying the direct orders of [[IBM]] and [[Thomas J. Watson]], became the main provider of [[computing]] expertise and equipment in [[Nazi]] [[Germany]]. Dehomag gave the Nazi party the means for a large [[census]] of the population and for searching its data.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

'''Loyalist College''' (formally '''Loyalist College of Applied Arts and Technology''') is an [[English language|English]]-language college in [[Belleville, Ontario|Belleville]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].

== History ==

Prior to the 1960s, only trade schools co-existed with universities in the province of Ontario at the post-secondary level, most of which had been established primarily to help veterans reintegrate into society in the post-war years. Loyalist College was founded in 1967 as part of a provincial initiative to create [[List of Ontario Colleges of Applied Arts and Technology|many such institutions]] to provide career-oriented [[diploma]] and [[Academic certificate|certificate]] courses, as well as [[continuing education]] programs to [[Ontario]] communities. The name of the college reflects the area's original settlement by [[United Empire Loyalist]]s.

Originally operated out of a local high school, Loyalist College moved to its present {{convert|200|acre|ha|adj=on}} campus on Wallbridge-Loyalist Road in 1968. The college operates a satellite campus in [[Bancroft, Ontario]] and is associated with [[First Nations Technical Institute]] in the [[Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory, Ontario, Ontario|Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory]] [[Indian reserve]].

== Academics ==

Loyalist College is well known in the region for its [[journalism]], [[photojournalism]] and [[radio]] and [[television]] broadcasting programs as well as its [[health services]] and [[Skilled Labour]] programs.

'''Club Atlético Independiente''' ({{IPA-es|ˈkluβ aˈtletiko indepenˈdjente}}) is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] athletic, sports and social club, which has its headquarters and stadium in the city of [[Avellaneda]], [[Greater Buenos Aires]]. The club is best known for its [[Association football|football]] team, that plays in the [[Primera B Nacional]] and is considered one of [[The Big Five of Argentine football|Argentina's ''Big Five'']] football clubs. The club holds a long-standing rivalry with neighbor [[Racing Club de Avellaneda]] in the [[Avellaneda derby]], referred to as ''El Clásico de Avellaneda''.

Independiente was officially founded on 1 January 1905, although the institution had been formed on 4 August 1904 and had already played in Argentina's first division. Originally from [[Monserrat, Buenos Aires|Monserrat]], a historic neighborhood of [[Buenos Aires]], the club moved to Avellaneda in 1907. It is the third team with most national league titles in the country (16, the last one being the [[2002–03 Argentine Primera División#Torneo Apertura|2002 Apertura]]). In international club football competitions, Independiente holds 16 titles, with a record seven [[Copa Libertadores]] wins, being the only club to win four finals in a row, between [[1972 Copa Libertadores|1972]] and [[1975 Copa Libertadores|1975]]. Additionally, the club has won three times the [[Copa Interamericana]], twice the [[Supercopa Sudamericana]], once the [[Recopa Sudamericana]], twice the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] ([[1973 Intercontinental Cup|1973]] and [[1984 Intercontinental Cup|1984]]), and the [[Copa Sudamericana]] in [[2010 Copa Sudamericana|2010]], its most recent title after 16 years without international wins. On 15 June 2013, after losing a match against San Lorenzo de Almagro, the professional football team was relegated for the first time in its history after 101 consecutive years in the first division and will be playing season 2013-2014 in the [[Nacional B]].

Other activities practised at the club are basketball, [[chess]], [[field hockey]], gymnastics, martial arts, [[roller skating]], swimming, tennis, volleyball and [[water polo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clubaindependiente.com/independiente/category/deportes/ Deportes at C.A. Independiente – official site]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Foundation===
In 1904, the employees of a store located in Monserrat had founded the Maipu FC, a football club. The mostly young employees only were allowed to watch the games but they could not play for the team. Because of that, they met in a bar located in front of the club and decided to break apart and to found a new club. The name chosen was &quot;Independiente&quot; (&quot;Independent&quot; in Spanish) to remark their independence from the Maipú FC.

[[File:Independiente 1909.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Independiente in 1909.]]
Rosendo Degiorgio was appointed interim president. The club gave a small room in his home district of Montevideo 1585 (Recoleta), to be the first clubhouse. There were the first meetings.

It was decided to call the first meeting at which it was established that will formalize the establishment of the club for Sunday 1 January 1905, at home partner Daniel Bevilacqua (Esmeralda 329, 3rd floor). On 25 March 1905 Aristides Langone was elected first elected president of the institution. Aristide gave the institution that belonged to his former club which by then was dissolved, the United Plate FV. This uniform was white, and his shield was adapted from that used the first football champion Argentina, the Saint Andrew's F. C.

The institution's first stadium was a humble sports ground in Boyacá and Shrimp (North Flores in 1905, Villa General Mitre today). In mid-1905 it moved to its second site, which is in Avenida San Martín, Donato Alvarez, also in Villa General Mitre. The third field in which they played was in the neighborhood of Palermo, in an area of the National College West (now Mariano Moreno), on the corner of Avenida Alvear Avenida del Libertador-today-and Tagle. The institution started playing there in late 1905 and remained there until April 1906. That site is now the stadium of Club Atlético River Plate Estadio Monumental Antonio before Vespucio Liberti. The fourth stadium was in Espinosa and Paysandú (in the neighborhood of La Paternal, from 27 May 1906 until the end of 1906. At the beginning of 1907, the institution settled in Avellaneda, on land located at Manuel Ocantos 540.

===Early years===
[[File:INDEPENDIENTE CAMPEON 1922.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Independiente in 1922, that year the team won its first title.]]
Independiente played its first game on Sunday 15 January 1905, against [[Club Atlético Atlanta|Atlanta]], in the &quot;bohemios&quot; field, losing 1–0. The next game was played on 22 January 1905 against Maipú Banfield F.C., which ended in a 0–0 draw. The club won the first game in its history with a resounding 11–0 win against Albion on 7 May 1905. Affiliated to the The Argentine Football Association, Independiente was allowed to play in the second and third division. The team at second played regularly but the squad at third division suffered a catastrophic defeat at the hands of Atlanta by 21–0.

However, the team was reorganized and played the first &quot;Avellaneda Derby&quot; in history, played on 9 June 1907. Independiente beat [[Racing Club de Avellaneda|Racing]] 3–2, although Racing supporters had predicted their team would win by a large result.

[[File:IND,1926 CAMPEON.JPG|thumb|right|200px|In 1926 the club won its second title in Primera.]]
That same year Independiente moved to its new field located in Avellaneda, which was built in Manuel Ocantos street. On 10 May 1908, the team played for the first time wearing the red jersey, in a match against [[Club Atlético Banfield|Banfield]] that Independiente won 9–2. The red color was adopted because of the identification of some of its founders with the socialist movement. In 1909, the Independiente team that took part in the Second Division won the Copa Bullrich, the first official trophy. Buruca Laforia Joseph, former seven-time [[Alumni Athletic Club (football)|Alumni]]'s goalkeeper, was part of the team.

On 9 July 1911, the club moved into its sixth field, which was also in La Crucecita district, more precisely in Mitre Avenue. It was celebrated with a match against Estudiantil Porteño, which Independiente won 1–0.

Independiente promoted to first division for being one of the two founder members (along with [[Gimnasia y Esgrima de Buenos Aires]]) of the Federación del Fútbol Argentina. Since 1912 the club would never be relegated to lower divisions up to the present moment.

===From white to red===
Independiente's original shirt was half blue and half white, with blue shorts, but in 1907, when President Arístides Langone saw [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]'s red outfit, he decided to give Independiente a new look. Langone thought they looked like &quot;red devils&quot;, which would later become Independiente's nickname. In 1908, in a match against Bristol of [[Uruguay]] (black-white stripes), Independiente wore the red outfit for the first time, having also changed their original name to '''Club Atlético Independiente'''. The original outfit is used as the second kit, using even the original logo.

===Amateur Era===
[[File:INDEPENDIENTE,1925.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The team that won the [[Copa de Competencia Jockey Club]] in 1925.]]
The stadium La Crucecita had been built in 1910 and destroyed by fire in 1923. By those years the &quot;[[Avellaneda derby]]&quot; was the most popular match in Argentina, even more than the &quot;[[Superclásico]]&quot;, as these clubs were involved in separate leagues until the arrival of professionalism faced only occasionally.

During the amateur era, Independiente won two titles, in 1922 (its first official trophy in Primera) and 1926 (where the team finished undefeated). Some notable players of those times were [[Manuel Seoane]] (all-time top scorer of amateur era) [[Zoilo Canavery]] and [[Raimundo Orsi]]. It was during the 1926 tournament that Independiente was nicknamed &quot;Diablos Rojos&quot; (&quot;Red Devils&quot;) for the first time. This nickname came from journalist Hugo Marini{{efn|This journalist also nicknamed &quot;El Fortín&quot; to [[Estadio José Amalfitani|Vélez Sársfield Stadium]].}} who worked at ''Crítica'' newspaper. Marini had stated that the forward line &quot;was like possessed by the Devil&quot; due to its skilled players that formed it. This nickname was accepted by followers and has remained since as the most popular nickname of the team.

[[File:Independiente 1938.jpg|thumb|right|200px|In 1938 Independiente won its first title in professional era, apart from the [[Copa Aldao]] and [[Copa Adrián Escobar]].]]
Independiente also won the [[Copa de Competencia Jockey Club]] (which succedeed an old version that &quot;The Diablos&quot; had won in 1917) in three consecutive times: 1924, 1925 and 1926. In 1927 the team reached the ''Campeonato Porteño'' finals.

In 1928 the club began to built its seven (and last, to date) stadium.  t is believed that managers chose concrete because unlike wood (the material of his previous stage) was a non-combustible material, and therefore would not suffer another fire. This stadium was officially opened on 4 March 1928, and it was the first stadium built in cement in Latin America (and the second worldwide). The stadium was soon nicknamed as &quot;La Doble Visera&quot; (&quot;The Double Visor&quot;) by journalists.

===Beginning of professional era===
[[File:Independiente1967.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The team in 1967, when winning the Nacional tournament.]]
In 1931 the professional era of Argentine football began. The first professional match was an 1–1 draw against [[Argentinos Juniors]] and the following match Independiente achieved its first victory, a 3–1 over [[Club Atlético Huracán|Huracán]]. At the end of the championship the first &quot;Avellaneda derby&quot; of professional era was played: it was won by Racing 7–4.

In 1937 [[Vicente de la Mata]], one of the most notable players in history, arrived at the club. With his contribution, Independiente won its first professional titles, in 1938 and 1939. [[Paraguay]]an forward [[Arsenio Erico]] was the all-time top scorer of the Argentine football with 295 goals in official matches, which is still a record. He had an average of 40 goals by season. Moreover, Erico was the top scorer of 1937, 1938 and 1939.

Independiente also won two [[Copa Ricardo Aldao]], which was disputed between champions from Argentina and Uruguay, and the winner was proclaimed as ''Campeón Rioplatense''. The squad defeated [[Peñarol]] in 1938 and [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional]] in 1939.

===The 1940s and 1950s===
During the 1940s Vicente de la Mata became a great player, with the nickname &quot;Capote&quot;, and a [[tango music|Tango]] with the same name was composed honoring him. Manuel López (lyrics) and Juan Sánchez Gorio (music) were the authors. In those times Independiente achieved several overwhelming victories. Some of them were 8–1 over Estudiantes de la Plata, a 5–0 over Vélez Sársfield, 7–1 over Boca Juniors and 7–0 over Racing Club, which is still the highest score in an Avellaneda derby. In 1941 Antonio Sastre left the club after playing 340 games for Independiente, and the following year it was Arsenio Erico who returned to Paraguay.

Independiente won a new title in 1948, defeating Racing 1–0 in the last fixture. At the end of the decade [[Ernesto Grillo]] (one of the most remembered players in the history of the club), made his debut.

In 1953 Independiente went on a European tour, which most outstanding victory was the 6–0 over [[Real Madrid]] (with [[Alfredo Di Stéfano]] as team's biggest star). Despite having toured successfully, the squad did not win any title in Argentina. Its best position was 2nd place in 1954.

===The conquest of the Libertadores and local titles===
[[File:Independiente 1965.jpg|thumb|left|230px|The team that won its second [[Copa Libertadores]] in 1965.]]
Independiente started the 60s with a league title, and then another in 1963. At that time, Independiente had more than 45,000 members, a remodeled stadium, and kept growing institutionally. But one of Independiente's greatest achievements would be in 1964, by becoming the first Argentine team to win the [[Copa Libertadores]]. Independiente repeated the title in 1965.


1967 would see Independiente win the Nacional tournament. This team would be one of the last few teams that used a 2–3–5 formation. The consagratory match would be in the Avellaneda derby nonetheless, against Racing Club. The game was won by Independiente 4–0.

Again, Independiente started a new decade by winning a title (Metropolitano 1970). The 70s would be Independiente's Golden Era by obtaining 12 important titles: Metropolitano 1970, 1971, Nacional 1977, 1978, [[Copa Libertadores]]1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] 1973, and [[Copa Interamericana]]1973, 1974, 1975.

Independiente greatest achievement in the 70s was to win the Copa Libertadores four times in a row. Also, the team would become famous by having the [[Ricardo Bochini]]-[[Daniel Bertoni]] attacking duo.

But Independiente's most memorable game was the final match of the Nacional of 1977 tournament, even though the match was played in 25 January 1978. The final was against [[Talleres de Córdoba]]. The first leg was a tie (1–1) at Independiente's stadium and in the final match in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], the match was tied on one goal apiece, but with only 15 minutes remaining Talleres scored a controversial goal. As a result, Independiente's players protested, but instead the referee gave the red card to three of the players. With only 8 players playing and a few minutes remaining, Independiente tied the game with an incredible goal by Bochini, assisted by Bertoni. Independiente became the champion by the away goal difference rule.

In 1983, Independiente would win another Metropolitano tournament. Then in 1984, the club would obtain its seventh Copa Libertadores and became the team with won that tournament most. Independiente then played against [[Liverpool F.C.]] in [[Tokyo, Japan]], for the Intercontinental Cup. The game ended in a victory for Independiente by 1–0, therefore winning the trophy for the second time.

The last important title that Independiente obtained in the 80s, was the 1988–89 season. Coached by [[Jorge Solari]], the squad's most notable players were Bochini as the team strategist and [[Carlos Alfaro Moreno]] being the top scorer of the season. Independiente played a total of 38 matches, winning 22, with 11 draws and being defeated 5 times. The team scored 58 goals and conceded 32.

===The 1990s and 2000s titles===

The 90s started with the retirement of [[Ricardo Bochini]] in 1991. A [[one club man]], in his 20 years of professional football from 1972 to 1991 Bochini played only for Independiente (and the [[Argentina national football team|national team]]), and participated in the club's Golden Era, with 8 international titles, and 4 Argentine championships. He played a total of 740 matches, scoring 107 goals.

Independiente would then win the 1994 Clausura, 1994 and 1995 [[Supercopa Sudamericana|Supercopa]], and the 1995 [[Recopa Sudamericana|Recopa]]. After winning the Recopa, Independiente then claimed 15 international titles.

After a 7-year drought without winning any important title, Independiente became champions of the [[2002–03 in Argentine football|Apertura 2002]]. This team, coached by [[Américo Gallego]], had an offensive style featuring [[Federico Insúa]], [[Daniel Montenegro]], [[Néstor Andrés Silvera|Andrés Silvera]], among other important Argentine players.

Even though Independiente obtained an Argentine title in 2002, the club was going through to a serious debt that had been accumulating since the 90s. At first, it was said that the debt was more than 50 million dollars, but in February 2006, the Argentine justice established that the debt was around 26 million.
With the transfer of [[Sergio Agüero]] to [[Atlético de Madrid]] for about 23 million euros, Independiente is hoping to pay off the debt. The club is taking its last steps into coming out of receivership.

The [[2006–07 in Argentine football|2006–07 season]] started with a lot of enthusiasm. With former star [[Jorge Burruchaga]] as the team manager, and notable players such as [[Daniel Montenegro]], [[Germán Denis]] and [[Óscar Ustari]], it was expected that the team would fight for the titles. The Apertura finished with Independiente in a fourth place, despite a very irregular campaign, which included a home loss against Gimnasia y Esgrima Jujuy in the last match ever played in the historic Libertadores de América Stadium.


The Clausura 2007 tournament was a total catastrophe. Having earned just 8 points in the first 10 matches, manager Burruchaga resigned after a home loss 0–2 against the modest Godoy Cruz de Mendoza. [[Miguel Ángel Santoro]] became the interim coach. The team finished unbeaten with him, winning 4 matches and the other 5 resulting in ties. Independiente finished 11th in the tournament, and missed classification to Libertadores and Sudamericana Cups by just 2 points.

[[Claudio Borghi]] took over as manager of the team in 2008, despite a good start, Borghi resigned after losing 3 matches in a row, and was replaced by [[Miguel Angel Santoro]] in his fourth spell as manager of the team. Many players were brought to revert the horrible 2007 campaign. Higher profile players such as Federico Higuaín, Leonel Rios, Emmanuel Centurion, Leandro Depetris, Leonel Nuñez and Dario Gandin were brought but the performance was not as expected. They were eliminated from the Copa Sudamericana in the 1st round and had three consecutive defeats in the 2008 Apertura (Newell's 0–1, 0–2 against Lanus and Huracan 0–1) that finalized the blow that was seeing the team fail to secure a top spot or enter an international competition .

The Reds were led by Americo Gallego, who left the champion with Independiente in Apertura 2002 after Santoro's resignation after a few dates in the Clausura 2009. Under the leadership of Santoro, Independiente is positioned at the 18th place of the 2008 Open over Rosario Central and River Plate 19 º 20 º. In summer, the club signed Eduardo Tuzzio and Paraguayan Diego Gavilan.

In Clausura 2009 Independiente had a very poor campaign in finishing 16th over 19 teams. Hopes were renewed for the Apertura 2009, due to the signings of talented striker [[Andrés Silvera]], [[Carlos Matheu]], [[Ignacio Piatti]], and other 5 first level players. Coach [[Américo Gallego]] reduced the size of the squad, letting go of 17 players including star attacking midfielder [[Daniel Montenegro]]. Those moves paid off, and Independiente finished the tournament with 34 points (4th).

===Decline and relegation===

For the Clausura 2010, Independiente's coach got some new important signings and were on top of the positions until nearly the end of the tournament. They ended up in the 4th position, and although the team qualified to the [[2010 Copa Sudamericana|Copa Sudamericana]], the board didn't offer Gallego a new contract.

The Apertura 2010 saw a very poor campaign for Independiente. The president, Julio Comparada, decided not to spend too much money on transfers as it was being spent on the works on the [[Estadio Libertadores de América]]. Moreover, some important players left the club, such as [[Ignacio Piatti]], [[Darío Gandín]], [[Walter Acevedo]] and [[Luciano Vella]]. General manager [[César Luis Menotti]] and head coach [[Daniel Garnero]] were sacked, and [[Antonio Mohamed]] was hired as coach. He gave a new look to the team after defeating their archrivals (Racing) 1–0. Even though the team stayed in the last positions of the domestic tournament, they advanced through the stages of the Copa Sudamericana, eventually winning the competition via [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]] in the final against [[Goiás Esporte Clube|Goiás]].

When Independiente's president, Julio Comparada, was replaced with Javier Cantero, the later revealed severe economic problems, that could bring Independiente to an end if they are not dealt accordingly. He revealed that the Club had 400 millon Argentine Pesos available and the team itself had severe problems with lineups.

River Plate's legend Ramón Diaz was signed to coach Independiente after the departure of Antonio Mohamed. The Diaz era started pretty well, with the team facing problems with promotion, El Rojo also had to play the Copa Sudamericana 2011, which ended with Independiente being sent out by Liga de Quito. When it was time to face Racing Club, Independiente could only get a 1–1 draw. After an average campaign on Apertura 2011, Independiente managed to qualify for Copa Sudamericana 2012.

In [[2012–13 Argentine Primera División season|2013 Torneo Inicial]] Independiente finished 18th of 20, accumulating 17 points in 19 matches. During the 2013 Torneo Final, with few fixtures remaining for the end of the tournament, [[Miguel Brindisi]] returned to the club as manager. Nevertheless, the team did not reverse its poor form, and was relegated to the  [[Primera B Nacional]] for the first time in its history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/deportes/Descenso-dia_0_938306433.html &quot;Sin milagro, Independiente descendió por primera vez en su historia&quot;], ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'', 15 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Estadio Libertadores de América}}
On 4 March 1928, in a match against Peñarol of Uruguay that ended in a draw, Independiente established the first stadium in South America. The stadium would later be known as ''Doble Visera.''

The Estadio Libertadores de América was closed for repairs in 2007, and reopened 28 October 2009 in a league match against Colón, which Independiente won 3–2. During construction, Independiente played their home games in four different fields.

'''Purple Mountain''' or '''Zijin Shan''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: [[wikt:紫|紫]][[wikt:金|金]][[wikt:山|山]], ''Zĭjīnshān'', lit. &quot;Purple-Gold Mountain&quot;) is located on the eastern side of [[Nanjing]] in [[Jiangsu]] province, [[China]]. It is 447.1&amp;nbsp;m (1467&amp;nbsp;ft) high, with the lowest point 30&amp;nbsp;m (98&amp;nbsp;ft). Its peaks are often found enveloped in mysterious purple and golden clouds at dawn and dusk, hence its name.

A small mountain with an area about 20 square kilometres (4,900 acres), Purple Mountain is a mountain related to many historical events of both ancient and modern China. It was originally known as '''Bell Mountain''' (&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt; [[wikt:鍾|鍾]][[wikt:山|山]], &lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|s]]&lt;/small&gt; [[wikt:钟|钟]][[wikt:山|山]], ''Zhōngshān'') and also became known as '''Mount Jiang''' (&lt;small&gt;[[traditional characters|t]]&lt;/small&gt; [[wikt:蔣|蔣]][[wikt:山|山]], &lt;small&gt;[[simplified characters|s]]&lt;/small&gt; [[wikt:蒋|蒋]][[wikt:山|山]], &lt;small&gt;[[pinyin|p]]&lt;/small&gt; ''Jiǎngshān'') after [[Sun Quan]] named [[Jiang Ziwen]], an [[Eastern Han]] official whose spirit was said to haunt the site, as the [[shanshen|mountain's god]] during the [[Three Kingdoms]] era.

More than 200 heritage and scenic tourist sites are now located in or around the mountain, among which include three national historical sites, nine provincial historical sites, and 33 prefectural historical sites. Located in or close to the hillside of Purple-Gold Mountain, there are also about a dozen national research institutes and universities.

Purple Mountain has 621 species of vascular plants, from 383 genera, 118 families (including 78 cultivated species).

'''Corel Linux''', also called '''Corel LinuxOS''', was a [[Debian]]-based [[operating system]] made by [[Corel]] that began beta testing on September 21, 1999&lt;ref name=&quot;BetaPR&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bloomberg.com/article/1999-09-21/aogEFJ8X3K5A.html | title=Corel Begins Beta-Testing of Corel® LINUX® | publisher=Bloomberg | date=1999-09-21 | accessdate=2013-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released to the public on November 15, 1999. It mainly competed against [[Windows 98]] and [[Windows 2000]] by [[Microsoft]], plus Mac OS 9 by [[Apple, Inc|Apple]]. Corel later discontinued the distribution, but did not remove the former Corel Open Source Development website until March 2002.

Corel did not use KFM, the standard [[KDE]] [[file manager]]. It instead used its own file manager, CFM. This, along with other modifications Corel made, made the operating system incompatible with other versions of Linux much more so than other competitors in the industry. At a time when there was relatively little Linux software available, this was a serious hurdle for Corel and its users.

The operating system's Second Edition was released on August 15, 2000 in download, regular and deluxe editions. The latter bundled Corel [[WordPerfect Office]] for Linux.

[[Xandros]] purchased the Corel Linux source code and development team when [[Corel]] scrapped its Linux business in August 2001. However, the Corel Corporation is a stockholder of Xandros.

== Features ==
Corel Linux featured a file manager that was very close in look and feel to [[Windows Explorer]]. The file manager provided an integrated Windows SMB [[network browser]].  The company also advertised that the operating system was compatible with its flagship software.

=== Applications ===
The key selling point of Corel Linux was its compatibility with the company's WordPerfect applications.  The eponymous word processor's eighth version was given away to personal customers in the hopes that they would purchase WordPerfect Office 2000.  This suite added the [[Quattro Pro]], [[Corel Presentations]] and CorelCentral programs.  The Deluxe version of that suite added the [[Paradox (database)|Paradox]] database manager and [[Railroad Tycoon II]] Gold. The latter omits a level editor, the network mode and some scenarios from the original game.  Unlike the free WordPerfect 8, the office suite was not written natively for Linux, but instead consisted of the Windows programs powered by Corel's fork of the [[Wine (software)|Wine]] [[compatibility layer]].  As a result, the Linux suite suffered from a performance penalty compared to the Windows version and WordPerfect 8.

As with the WordPerfect suite, Corel adapted its graphics applications to run on Linux using Wine.  This consisted of the [[CorelDRAW|CorelDraw]] (stylized CorelDRAW) suite.  While the eponymous program was paid software, [[Corel Photo-Paint]] was available as a free download.

=== SmartMove === &lt;!-- This subheading is redirected to from [[SmartMove]], is the sub-heading is changed or removed, please also edit that redirect. Thank you.--&gt;
Corel '''SmartMove''' was a part of Corel Linux. This application provided the following:
# Migrate Microsoft Windows settings to Corel Linux.
# Automate restoring settings that are changed by SmartMove.
# Provide an easy way to access network folders through Corel Linux.

SmartMove was built around the [[Wine (software)|Wine]] libraries to read the [[Windows registry]] settings for the Windows applications and thus be able to migrate them. SmartMove core libraries created a wrapper for the Windows registry to easily look up the settings.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
SmartMove looks for existing [[Microsoft Windows]] installations on the machine, looks a little further for individual users, and offers to transfer application settings to analogous programs under Linux. It understands how to deal with [[Internet Explorer]] and [[Netscape]] cookies and bookmarks, [[Microsoft Outlook|Outlook]], [[mIRC]], and [[ICQ]] settings, and a variety of desktop preferences, including wallpaper, color scheme, and even mouse &quot;handedness&quot;. We tried it out with a few settings, but since our Windows installation was fairly new, we didn't have much to check against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/previews/2159/4/ |title=Sneak Preview: Corel Linux OS Second Edition |accessdate=2007-03-19 |last=Hall |first=Michael |date=2000-08-07 |work=LinuxPlanet }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With the death of Corel Linux, this application faded away and is no longer maintained, however similar functionality is now available on at least Ubuntu when installing a dual-boot configuration on a machine that already has Windows on it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/7.04Tour#head-7fb72f38a89c243a38487143fda3a3655d5ded80 Ubuntu feature announcement from Ubuntu 7.04 release]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory''' is a 73&amp;nbsp;km² (18000-[[acre]]) [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] [[Indian reserve]] on the [[Bay of Quinte]] in southeastern [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], east of [[Belleville, Ontario|Belleville]] and immediately to the west of [[Deseronto, Ontario|Deseronto]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JohansenMann2000&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Bruce E. Johansen]]|author2=Barbara Alice Mann|title=Encyclopedia of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois Confederacy)|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zibNDBchPkMC&amp;pg=PA320|accessdate=11 December 2011|year=2000|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30880-2|page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt; It serves as the land base for the [[Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte]] (Kenhtè:ke Kanyen'kehá:ka) [[First Nation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JohansenMann2000&quot;/&gt;

The community takes its name from a variant spelling of Mohawk leader [[Joseph Brant]]'s traditional Mohawk name, Thayendanegea (standardized spelling Thayentiné:ken), which means 'two pieces of fire wood beside each other'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tyendinaga&quot;&gt;Isaac, Ruth et al. ''A Spelling Worldist of Six Nations Mohawk''. Brantford: The Woodland Indian Cultural-Educational Centre, 1986. Print&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, in the [[Mohawk language]], the community is called '''&quot;Kenhtè:ke&quot;''', an old word, the meaning of which is unclear.  The [[Cayuga language|Cayuga]] name is ''Tayęda:ne:gęˀ or Detgayę:da:negęˀ'', &quot;land of two logs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== History ==
Following the [[American Revolution]], the Mohawk, who were allies of the British Crown, lost their traditional homelands in the [[Mohawk Valley]] of what became [[New York]] state, when they were forced to cede their lands following the defeat of the British. As compensation for their allegiance, the Crown offered them unsettled land in [[Upper Canada]]. A group of Mohawk led by [[John Deseronto]] selected the Bay of Quinte because it allegedly was the birthplace of [[Great Peacemaker|Tekanawita]], one of the founders of the original [[Iroquois Confederacy]] in the 12th century.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbq-tmt.org/community/history-of-tyendinaga|title=History of Tyendinaga|publisher=Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte|accessdate=2011-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 22, 1784, the group of 20 families (between 100 to 125 people) arrived. Nine years later, the Tyendinaga tract of land was officially set aside under Crown Treaty 3½, signed on April 1, 1793, by Lieutenant Governor [[John Graves Simcoe]] and thereafter known as the 'Simcoe Deed'. This tract of land, measuring {{convert|92700|acre}}, was legally accepted by the British Crown, and subsequently by the Canadian Government.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

But a wave of [[United Empire Loyalist|Loyalists]] also settled in the Bay of Quinte area, and the government granted many of whom land in the Tyendinaga Tract. During the period from 1820 to 1843, the Mohawk lost two-thirds of the treaty lands of the Simcoe Deed. Further land loss has left the Mohawk with only {{convert|71|km2|acre}} today in this area today.  Other groups settled in the [[Six Nations Reserve]], [[Kahnawake]], [[Kanesatake, Quebec|Kanesatake]], [[Wahta Mohawk Territory|Wahta]] and [[Akwesasne]] (the latter three were established Mohawk settlements prior to the war.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

==Land Claims dispute==
Currently the Mohawk of the Bay of Quinte are embroiled in a land claim struggle with the Canadian government over a stretch of land referred to as the Culbertson Tract.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vogt1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Roy Vogt|title=Whose Property?: The Deepening Conflict Between Private Property and Democracy in Canada|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WkOxhZ9Gq-MC&amp;pg=PA104|accessdate=11 December 2011|date=1 May 1999|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0-8020-8186-5|pages=104–106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mohawk allege it was illegally purchased in the 19th century; the terms and conditions for purchasing land from Natives which had been set out in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 required there to be a community vote before the Mohawk could sell the common land to any outsider.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vogt1999&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocap.ca/node/667 |title=Tyendinaga and The Struggle for the Land &amp;#124; Ontario Coalition Against Poverty |publisher=Ocap.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research and documentation has shown that these terms and conditions may not have been followed.&lt;ref name=&quot;CassidyBish1989&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frank Cassidy|author2=Robert L.

After a stagnation of the land claims process following protests in 2006-2009, the Band Chief Don Maracle in January 2011 announced his intentions to file a suit related to the land claims that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quintenews.com/2011/01/mohawks-want-culbertson-land-returned/ |title=Quinte News – Mohawks Want Culbertson Land Returned |publisher=Quintenews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
As of January 2011, the registered population of the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte Nation is 8,006 members (the third largest band in Ontario), of whom 2,124 live on the Tyendinaga reserve and 5,864 live off reserve.&lt;ref name=INAC&gt;Indian and Northern Affairs Canada - First Nation Profiles: [http://pse5-esd5.ainc-inac.gc.ca/FNP/Main/Search/FNRegPopulation.aspx?BAND_NUMBER=164&amp;lang=eng Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte Registered Population]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Tyendinaga is home to [[First Nations Technical Institute]], an educational partner with [[Canadore College]], [[First Nations University of Canada]], [[Humber College]], [[Loyalist College]], [[Queen's University]], [[Ryerson University]], [[St. Lawrence College, Ontario|St. Lawrence College]] and [[Trent University]]. FNTI is Canada's only Aboriginal owned and controlled college, offering program in Aviation (in partnership with the [[Tyendinaga (Mohawk) Airport]]), Law, Public Relations, Indigenous Community Health and the [[Mohawk language]].

The reserve also has a primary school, [[Quinte Mohawk School]]. For secondary school, on-reserve residents have the option of attending [[Moira Secondary School]] in [[Belleville, Ontario|Belleville]] just to the west of the reserve, or attending the Ohahase Learning Centre, a private secondary school operated by the [[First Nations Technical Institute]].&lt;ref name=&quot;education&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fnti.net/ohahase-learning-centre |title=Ohahase Learning Centre |publisher=FNTI |date=2010-05-27 |accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohahase means &quot;new road&quot; in the Mohawk language.&lt;ref name=&quot;education&quot; /&gt;

The language group Tsi Tyonnheht Onkwawenna organizes a variety of cultural educational programs, including Mohawk language classes and language documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news
