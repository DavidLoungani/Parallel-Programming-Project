Academy Award for Best Actor
									From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia																									Jump to:					navigation, 					search								Academy Award for Best ActorAwarded forBest Performance by an Actor in a Leading RoleCountryUnited StatesPresented byAMPASFirst awarded1929Currently held byMatthew McConaughey,Dallas Buyers Club (2013)Official websitewww.oscars.orgThe Academy Award for Best Actor is an award presented annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). It was first awarded at the 1st Academy Awards ceremony, held in 1929; Emil Jannings received the award for his roles in The Last Command and The Way of All Flesh and it is given in honor of an actor who has delivered an outstanding performance in a leading role while working within the film industry.[1] Currently, nominees are determined by single transferable vote within the actors branch of AMPAS; winners are selected by a plurality vote from the entire eligible voting members of the Academy.[2]In the first three years of the awards, actors were nominated as the best in their categories. At that time, all of their work during the qualifying period (as many as three films, in some cases) was listed after the award.[3] However, during the 3rd ceremony held in 1930, only one of those films was cited in each winner's final award, even though each of the acting winners had two films following their names on the ballots.[4] The following year, this unwieldy and confusing system was replaced by the current system in which an actor is nominated for a specific performance in a single film.[3] Starting with the 9th ceremony held in 1937, the category was officially limited to five nominations per year.[3]Since its inception, the award has been given to 77 actors. Matthew McConaughey is the most recent winner in this category for his role in Dallas Buyers Club. At the ceremony held in 2013, Daniel Day-Lewis became the first actor to win in this category three times, surpassing Marlon Brando, Gary Cooper, Tom Hanks, Dustin Hoffman, Fredric March, Jack Nicholson, Sean Penn and Spencer Tracy who all have two wins. Tracy and Laurence Olivier have been nominated on nine occasions, more than any other actor.Contents1 Winners and nominees2 Multiple awards for Best Actor3 Multiple nominations for Best Actor4 Age superlatives5 See also6 Notes7 References8 Bibliography9 External linksWinners and nominees[edit]In the following tables, the years are listed as per Academy convention, and generally correspond to the year of film release in Los Angeles County; the ceremonies are always held the following year.[5][6] For the first five ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned twelve months from August 1 to July 31.[7] For the 6th ceremony held in 1934, the eligibility period lasted from August 1, 1932 to December 31, 1933.[7] Since the 7th ceremony held in 1935, the period of eligibility became the full previous calendar year from January 1 to December 31.[7]Wallace Beery (top) and Fredric March (bottom) tied in 1931 for their roles in The Champ (Beery) and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (March).

George Arliss, Maurice Chevalier, and Ronald Colman were all nominated for two different roles in the same category. Current Academy rules forbid this from happening. No official reason was ever given as to why Arliss won the award for only one of the two films he was listed for.[93]B1 2 : Fredric March received one more vote than Wallace Beery. Academy rules at that time considered such a close margin to be a tie, so both March and Beery received the award. Under current Academy rules, however, dual awards are given only for exact ties.[94]C^ : Paul Muni's performance in Black Fury was not nominated for an Oscar. For two years only, the Academy allowed a write-in vote.[95][96] Technically, this meant that any performance was eligible for the award. The decision was made the previous year in response to the controversy surrounding Bette Davis's failure to receive a nomination for Of Human Bondage. Muni came 2nd in the vote, however, the Academy does not recognise Davis or Muni as nominees in these years.[97][98]References[edit]^ "Rule One: Award Definitions".
